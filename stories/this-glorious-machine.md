<p class="intro">Riding an e-bike is like discovering a long forgotten secret of the universe or, perhaps, inventing something worthy of a heartfelt “eureka.” Look: zipping through traffic on my first e-bike, blitzing past the stuffy tin cans all around me, I’ve become master of the four winds. Now first place in a triathlon, now a mythical creature that can move at the speed of thought. Upon my trusty electric 6-gear steed I am Hermes, lord of heavenly motion.</p>

And the sound! An e-bike makes every thunk, whip, and whirl that you might find in a comic book: gears rattling, spokes spinning. Just listen to this thing go! I’m dashing between cars and blurry, bipedal pedestrians, and right now, on my first ride to work, I can’t stop smiling.

I’m smiling because, unlike so many promises that tech has failed to deliver, e-bikes are genuinely worthy of an hour-long presentation delivered in a turtleneck. If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, then an e-bike is a bicycle for our bicycles, a wonder of micro-mobility as they reimagine our relationship with our bodies and our cities and even with the future of technology itself.

Simply put...


## E-bikes aren’t a dumb tech grift.

<p class="intro">As I weave through double parked cars and brave pedestrians, I see that this bicycle with an electric motor has returned the hope I’d lost over the years. Here, listen, it whispers: tech doesn’t have to be a con or make us the worst versions of ourselves. Look: technology has kept its promise and genuinely made the world better!</p>

My e-bike is pulling me into an alternate dimension where tech isn’t designed to be a grift from the start, as these two-wheeled bad boys aren’t only here to generate shareholder value; they’re designed to help.

I’m halfway through my ride now and it’s dawning on me that this little e-bike of mine offers a critique against tech culture as a mere profit-generating tool, sure. But this machine comes with a vision, too. A vision of what a city should be and how we ought to navigate it.

It’s clear from this ride that our cities have been built all wrong as for more than a century we’ve incentivized cars to segment and separate our country into human-free zones and endless freeways with generic, Lego-like blocks copy and pasted in between. Although, my e-bike, as brilliant as it may be, is a well-designed hack on top of all that. It’s a patch on top of poor city planning and underfunded public infrastructure.

Our cities don’t have to work like this and e-bikes show us a clear way out: every e-bike is a manifesto for lost common spaces, huge sidewalks with giant trees above and local shops within walking distance. Parks! Places you can sit down! Shade! Shelter! Not just an in-between place or a hurdle to circumnavigate between your job and your home, e-bikes argue for a city to be proud of instead. And isn’t that what tech was supposed to do, show us a way out?

Wasn’t tech supposed to show us the future?


## E-bikes are more punk rock than punk rock.

<p class="intro">For a decade my primary method of transportation was a motorcycle. Back in my early 20s I believed there was nothing more punk than an exploding hunk of metal beneath me. Roaring, screaming through dinky villages in Devon or across the sparse and shining cities of southern California.</p>

Bicycles were the opposite of all that freedom. For decades I associated them with my childhood and being trapped in my tiny hometown without access to the wider world. Bicycles weren’t objects of desire or of longing because they simply weren’t fast or loud. And to be cool there always has to be volume and speed. Drums? Fast. Loud. Cool. Hip hop? Same. Motorcycles? What did you say? I can’t hear you because my eardrums have shattered and all that remains is a wonderful, heart-stompingly loud vibration in my chest; loudness personified and loudness eternal.

But now, as I’m slipping between cars on my first e-bike after two decades of being a total jerk and looking down on cyclists, I’m embarrassed to say I’ve thoroughly learned my lesson. Bicycles, and e-bikes specifically, are genuine wonders. Somehow strapping an electric motor onto a bicycle changes everything for me.

Here’s the kicker though. E-bikes aren’t cool because of the way they look or how loud they are and they’re certainly not cool because they turn heads or make strangers jealous. Instead, e-bikes don’t care about cool. They argue for a new kind of world where technology is genuinely helpful, where technology doesn’t have to be cool at all.

Technology can just do the job it’s meant to.


## E-bikes are the future we deserve.

<p class="intro">Almost home now, stopping for a kid to cross the street. She’s smiling and dancing, oblivious to the world around her, but now she’s caught sight of me, looking me up and down. Slowly, she raises her hand up to her head in the shape of an L.</p>

Who knew that a simple gesture could undo years of therapy in a flash? And sure, I might very well be a nerd, a loser, perhaps even a dreaded cyclist now but no matter how much I love this machine it will never be truly cool. But isn’t that...fine?

Cool tech is overrated anyway. We tend to think of cool in all the wrong ways because we only see cool as loudness and speed and aluminum, presented on stage to glorious fanfare. We see minimalism and a hefty price tag or the unrealistic, bewildering promise that can’t possibly be kept and we think that’s cool. Yet we tend not to think about hearing aids or MRI machines or clean drinking water or contact lenses. We don’t think of small, meaningful progress as cool and this limits our understanding of what technology is capable of and what role we should play in it.

As someone who’s worked in tech for more than a decade (sorry) I’ve seen how a lot of folks in the industry are terrified of making something merely useful. It must be important! It must scale! It must have a million eyes on it! And I’ve sat through meetings where progress isn’t measured by real progress, but rather a bunch of abstract numbers in an ugly spreadsheet. So—ranting aside—I reckon technology can only truly help us if we ignore what’s cool. Imagine no more handsome, turtlenecked speeches or rapturous applause. Imagine no more dumb catchphrases or logo redesigns or promises that can’t possibly be kept.

Rather, e-bikes ask us a new and exciting question:

## What if we made something useful instead?
