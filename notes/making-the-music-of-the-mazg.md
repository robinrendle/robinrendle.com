extract: Robin Sloan on machine learning.
---

In a lovely post about [the relationship between fiction writing and machine learning](https://www.mcdbooks.com/features/sourdough), Robin Sloan discusses how he wrote songs for his novel Sourdough with the help of artificial intelligence. However, Robin has some issues with that phrase in this context:

> I’ve taken pains to call this “machine learning,” not “artificial intelligence,” because, in this case, there’s really nothing intelligent about it. These systems — whether they’re working on text, images, or audio — learn statistical models that allow them to mimic the structure of the material they’re trained on. For example, the system I trained on old science fiction stories knows that if it has generated the character T, followed by the character H, it ought next to generate E, or maybe A, or O — but almost certainly not F, or J, or Q. If you can imagine many, many of these probabilities linked in a sprawling mesh: you have a rough model of the English language.
