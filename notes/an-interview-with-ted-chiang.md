I like this bit from [an interview](https://electricliterature.com/ted-chiang-explains-the-disaster-novel-we-all-suddenly-live-in/) with Ted Chiang:

> ...traditional “good vs. evil” stories follow a certain pattern: the world starts out as a good place, evil intrudes, good defeats evil, and the world goes back to being a good place. These stories are all about restoring the status quo, so they are implicitly conservative. Real science fiction stories follow a different pattern: the world starts out as a familiar place, a new discovery or invention disrupts everything, and the world is forever changed.

I really enjoyed Ted’s collection of short sci-fi stories, _[Exhalation](https://bookshop.org/a/269/9781101947883)_, too.
