Ethan Marcotte’s [talk at New Adventures](https://newadventuresconf.com/2019/coverage/ethan/) is very well much worth your time if you care for the web. Ethan broadens the scope of what accessibility means and argues that it goes beyond writing good HTML and CSS. It’s about making a web, and a world, for all of us.

Ethan’s talks are the kind I aspire to though; beautiful design, wondrous pacing, and an endless supply of wit. In short, I hate it.
