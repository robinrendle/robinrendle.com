James Bridle on [museums, archivists, and art](http://booktwo.org/notebook/the-great-bonfire-at-the-end-of-time/):

> And at some point I had this vision of the great bonfire at the end of time, and how there’s this conveyor belt moving towards it, filled with everything we’ve ever made: every word, every image, every artifact of culture and society, getting closer to the fire all the time.
>
> And the job of places like the Library, of most institutions, and of a significant part of culture, is to keep shoving everything back, away from the fire, to find ways to restore and revive and convert it so that it stays accessible and meaningful and useful and beautiful.
>
> And the job of the rest of the culture is to come up with new things to put on the conveyor belt, making that work so much harder. Sorry.
