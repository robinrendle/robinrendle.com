Someone sent me an email the other week and wrote this line that I’ve been thinking about ever since:

> How to talk deeply about a subject but carry yourself lightly?

I have no idea how to do this—to talk about Big and Serious things whilst also not letting it all get to your head. And I find that there are certain subjects like Brexit where I just cannot sit back and relax and debate it amicably with someone. There’s too much anger and vitriol in me about this subject where I always get carried away and suddenly find myself ranting, talking down, bullying someone into submission with everything in my head.

I feel like this question is something I’m going to be thinking about for very long time.
