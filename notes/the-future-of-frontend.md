Here’s a nifty event hosted by Sentry that’s all about [the future of front-end development](https://futureoffrontend.splashthat.com/):

> Join us on November 10th for yet another virtual event. Learn how application monitoring is more than just a failsafe for frontend development — it’s a competitive advantage that improves collaboration, code, customer happiness, and your own smug sense of self-satisfaction.

I’ll be there listening to the talks and live blogging along to it.
