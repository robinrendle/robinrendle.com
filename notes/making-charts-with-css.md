In _[Making charts with CSS](https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/)_ over on CSS-Tricks I take a look at a few interesting ways to make bar charts, sparklines and pie charts without resorting to a JavaScript framework. Using JS isn’t necessarily a problem here but sometimes we don’t need extra resources and a lot of the time we can handle things with CSS.

I’m already making notes for the next post on making charts with SVG, so be sure to look out for that one too.
