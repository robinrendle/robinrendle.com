extract: And the praise of a search engine deity.

I love it when blog post titles are indecipherable to search engines. There are exceptions, like when you want to document a technical thing and so you should have a blog post title describe that but the majority of the time I feel like blog post titles should sound like the chapters of a book: cool and not entirely obvious what they’re about.

There’s something so dang refreshing about making something for the sake of the thing, rather than for the random praise of a search engine deity.
