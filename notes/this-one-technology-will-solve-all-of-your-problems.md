This post by Kelly Sutton all about [how a new technology is rarely the solution to our problems](https://kellysutton.com/2019/03/23/this-one-technology-will-solve-all-of-your-problems.html) is my new favorite thing:

> Lately at work, I’ve found myself being a particularly conservative and sometimes curmudgeonly voice in the room when it comes to technical decisions. There’s no particular authority bestowed upon me, but at times I’ll get asked to weigh in on technical decisions for the engineering org. When it comes to introducing new technology, my response usually takes the form of “Why now?”

I particularly like this bit, too:

> ...new technology seems easy because we don’t know anything about it yet.

I want to underline this sentence with !!!s and !?!?s because I adore it entirely and see how this thread ties into what I’m seeing going on with the CSS community at the moment.
