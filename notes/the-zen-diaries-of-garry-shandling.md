Last night I watched the new documentary about Garry Shandling by Judd Apatow and I hadn’t quite expected to fall in love with it as much as I did. Quite frankly, it swept me off my feet. There’s so much that I adore about the film – the way they show extracts from Garry’s diaries, to the way the film slowly reveals Garry’s eccentricities, his fears, his wild and self-harming ambition, or his kindness. In short: I highly recommend you sit down for a whole evening and watch this thing, even if you don’t care much for Garry’s comedy or his TV shows. It’s delightful regardless.

Here’s the trailer for the documentary:
