extract: Steven Soderbergh’s edit of Raiders of the Lost Arc
---

Umm...uhhh...there is an edit of _Raiders of the Lost Arc_ by Steven Soderbergh and it is [the single most perfect thing](http://extension765.com/soderblogh/18-raiders). No greater, more perfectest thing has ever existed. It’s in black and white with the soundtrack from _The Social Network_ thrown on top of it. Just go watch it.

Soderbergh also wrote about why he made this lovely and haunting edit:

> I’m assuming the phrase “staging” came out of the theatre world, but it’s equally at home (and useful) in the movie world, since the term (roughly defined) refers to how all the various elements of a given scene or piece are aligned, arranged, and coordinated. In movies the role of editing adds something unique: the opportunity to extend and/or expand a visual (or narrative) idea to the limits of one’s imagination—a crazy idea that works today is tomorrow’s normal.

> I value the ability to stage something well because when it’s done well its pleasures are huge, and most people don’t do it well, which indicates it must not be easy to master (it’s frightening how many opportunities there are to do something wrong in a sequence or a group of scenes. Minefields EVERYWHERE. Fincher said it: there’s potentially a hundred different ways to shoot something but at the end of the day there’s really only two, and one of them is wrong). Of course understanding story, character, and performance are crucial to directing well, but I operate under the theory a movie should work with the sound off, and under that theory, staging becomes paramount...
