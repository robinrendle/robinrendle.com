Here’s Michelle Barker on why we should [stop using AI-generated images](https://css-irl.info/stop-using-ai-generated-images/):

> By choosing AI-generated images over those made by a human, editors are taking away one of the only sources of income available to those entering the field. This means that fewer people will choose to train in the profession. It will disproportionately affect those from low-income backgrounds, unable to justify the high cost of an art education with little prospect of earning a living. Illustration will become the preserve of the already well-off.

I always thought those AI-generated images in blog posts and elsewhere around the web were tacky and lame, but I hadn’t seriously considered the future economic impact on illustrators.
