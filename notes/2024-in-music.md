One thing I get real excited about every year is [Collyâ€™s music roundup](https://colly.com/journal/twenty-twentyfour-in-music) where he collects his favorite albums and presents them as a gift for all to enjoy. I tend to keep this page in a tab for a month or so, sifting through it slowly one by one and treating it as my guide for finding new stuff I missed throughout the year.

I trawled through it quickly this morning with a sturdy coffee in hand and clocked more than a dozen tracks that had me bopping up and down.
