I’ve only just stumbled upon [Nuform Type](https://nuformtype.com/) from [Erik Marinovich](http://www.erikmarinovich.com/) but I’m so glad that I did. His type foundry has some remarkable work and beautiful fonts but the websites! Man, the websites. I wish my eye for shape and color was half as good as this stuff.

I say that because every page of this site has been lovingly designed to showcase the fonts on display and there’s so many fabulous details all over the place. There’s a real playfulness here but there’s clearly been a serious amount of work thrown into it all.

(My favorite of the bunch is [Roko](https://nuformtype.com/roko).)
