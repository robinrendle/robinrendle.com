_The Murderbot Diaries_ by Martha Wells is fantastic. I admit that I’m real late to the party here but I can't remember the last time I read anything as effortlessly page-turning as this. The first book, _All Systems Red_, is a breezy 150 page novella that I finished last night and it’s all about a murderous robot on a distant planet way in the future. It’s funny and weird and I refuse to describe anything more about it.

Also, [Martha Wells’ website](https://www.marthawells.com/) totally rules.
