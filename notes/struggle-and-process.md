> The way I’ve seen great work made isn’t using any sort of design process. It’s skipping steps when we deem them unnecessary. It’s doing them out of order just for the heck of it. It’s backtracking when we’re unsatisfied. It’s changing things after we’ve handed off the design. It’s starting from the solution first. It’s operating on vibes and intuition. It’s making something just for the sake of making people smile. It’s a feeling that we nailed it.

I remember this chap at design school who got full marks every time. Full scores all the way through. But whenever I sat down and looked at his work I was shocked at how dry and boring it was, how _average_ it felt. The work was okay! It did the job! It was better than mine! 

But the work didn’t _sing_, ya know?

It feels like a lot of design process stuff is the same kinda thing. It’s trying to go for full marks for showing the thinking, showing the process — pretending to be a science when this whole thing is way, way more art. But the way to get to a great anything is messy and stupid and wrong right up until the point when it ain’t. 

The only sure-fire process to creating a really good thing is [struggling for a very long time](https://rachsmith.com/comfortable-with-the-struggle/).
