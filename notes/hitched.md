We got hitched!

It was a Friday afternoon—bright and cold, with a cloudless blue sky—when our small group headed to San Francisco City Hall for the ceremony; my brother had flown in from the UK for the first time and we’d spent the week prior walking around and doing touristy things like going to Alcatraz; some friends had driven up from southern California or travelled across the bridge; C’s family came over from the Outer Sunset, with her sister translating everything during the ceremony.

C wore a beautiful dress that she’d retrofitted, adding a veil that trailed behind her and ten thousand other adjustments and tweaks that she would never brag about but I certainly will. 

The night before, with our pal, we stayed up late working on the boutonnières and the bouquet. It was here that I discovered my incomprehensible, unfathomable ignorance when it comes to flower arrangement. I thought it would be just like graphic design where you move contrasting shapes and colors, arrange a space into something comprehensible. IT’S JUST A BUNCH OF PLANTS, MATE. 

But there’s a hierarchy of flowers—rules and regulations to their placement—that’s invisible to me. So our pal saved the day with her eye for details like that.

I could write ten thousand words about this three piece suit from [Tailor’s Keep](http://tailorskeep.com) and the joy of watching the amazing folks who made it. Just like the flowers, I discovered that there’s so much to learn when it comes to wearing a suit! The way that a jacket should compliment your body, the way that a shirt should show just a bit of sleeve underneath, and how you can add details to it that no-one else can see. Just for kicks.

Like on the inside of this jacket, where if you peel it back you’ll find a shimmering gold pattern that looks like the ceiling of a chateau.

During the ceremony, as my brother passed the rings over to the officiant, someone goofed the hand-off and one of the rings tumbled to the floor. Everyone in the our group gasped and then broke into awkward laughter. “5 second rule,” I whispered to C as she hastily picked it up and gave it to me.

We took our vows and then bolted for the exit.

Next? [The Interval](https://theinterval.org/), the home of the Long Now Foundation, and an astonishing bar on the tip of the Marina with drinks that are far too good in a *forgettable-oh-no-I-have-drunk-too-much sort of way*. Our friends joined us, cheered for us, took pictures by the water, and a grand total of zero speeches were given (as it should be).
