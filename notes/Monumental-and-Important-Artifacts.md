extract: I love this time of year.

I love this time of year for the satisfying blocks of website tinkering. There are big mornings and long afternoons spent with a new CSS feature. Or a whole weekend rewriting the about page, fixing dark mode, poking, prodding. Every morning I head to a cafe and see what’s possible.

Being productive or making something good isn’t really the point. It’s more about experimentation and learning new things. There’s no demand for doing something big or important around this time of year either. The big work has mostly been done over the summer, everything is slowing way down, so the pressure eases off. My expectations for my work and my website disappears and a big cozy relief sets in.

I wish I could see my work and my website like this throughout the year, as tools to tinker with and games to play, rather than Monumental and Important Artifacts to Behold.
