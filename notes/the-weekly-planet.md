Robinson Meyer just started a newsletter about the environment called [_The Weekly Planet_](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/weekly-planet/) that I’m pretty excited about. He’s on the climate crisis beat for _The Atlantic_, where he writes:

> Many readers, as well as some of my own colleagues, think it’s a depressing job. But in the past few years, I’ve become convinced that this story—the effort to understand climate change, to live with it, and to fight it—is the most thrilling tale of our time.

Robinson is one of my favorite journalists; he’s focused and organized and never condescending or cheap. Every time I read a piece of his I walk away feeling as if I’m 1% smarter and the world is more nuanced than I first assumed.

So go subscribe to this thing.
