I’ve always loved a good footer at the end of a website. It sets the tone for how you leave, gives you links to more interesting things, and is the last chance for a bit of whimsy and fun and charm.

[footer.design](https://footer.design) is a great collection of footers that shows us how to do them justice. They can be big and bold or bog standard and nondescript. They can be colorful and wild, meandering and meek. There’s so many opportunities in the footer!

And now I must go and make the footers here more fun. To the redesign!
