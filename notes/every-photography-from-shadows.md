I took a lot of photos for [_In Praise of Shadows_](https://robinrendle.com/essays/in-praise-of-shadows) and after a ton of humming and hawing and editing in Lightroom, I think I discovered at least one or two good pictures in the batch. So! Considering I hid all that with the stubborn text sitting on top, I thought it would be fun to show all the photographs here.
