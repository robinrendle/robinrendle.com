Earlier this week I flew down to a friend’s home in Anaheim for Thanksgiving and, in between home made apple pies and far too much turkey, I found time to update the design of this ol’ place a bit. Now I’m using Klim Type’s [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/) for headings and the ever-so-lovely [Newzald](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/newzald/) for body copy and blockquotes. The new design is _extremely_ first year graphic design student: everything is black with that giant sans and it all says “hello, yes, I’m moving to New York!” (Although I’m not.)

I wouldn’t really say this is a redesign though, as I’ve just improved the typesetting so it ought to be considerably easier to read. I think the interesting thing about this is how will this feel? Does this dark-mode-esque style suit my writing? Does the bold sans and declarative _oomph_ of Söhne match my tone and voice? Will this design change my writing in some way?

These are all questions that I’m excited to find answers to.
