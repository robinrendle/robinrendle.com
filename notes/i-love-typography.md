For some daft reason I keep forgetting that you can buy fonts from [I Love Typography](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/) now. They have [a growing catalogue](https://ilovetypography.com/2021/11/24/new-indie-foundries/) of foundries with buck wild designs and it’s worth coming back to see what just released.

Take [Platia](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/fonts/omega-type-foundry/platia?_ga=2.112748740.1969796624.1637808268-139424884.1637808268) by Omega Type Foundry for example. Lots of swirling, beautiful numerals and short, compact glyphs over there. Or [Koning Display](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/fonts/lucasfonts/koning-display) by Lucas Fonts with those endearing, chunky slabs of loveliness.
