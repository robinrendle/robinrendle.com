I’ve been obsessed with blend modes over the past couple of weeks. First it started when I noticed how the Almanac was missing both [`mix-blend-mode`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mix-blend-mode/) and [`background-blend-mode`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/) so I went ahead and fixed that.

Even though I’d been through the [docs](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/#propdef-background-blend-mode) and traversed [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) thoroughly for these posts I very almost missed that it’s possible to [chain blend modes](https://css-tricks.com/chaining-multiple-blend-modes/) together when adding multiple images to a background. It’s pretty neat.
