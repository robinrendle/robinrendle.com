Last night I sat down to test out a mic I just picked up and boy howdy I didn’t know I had this rant in me. In the future I’ll keep these much shorter perhaps but this one is apparently about:

- Audio logs and videogames!
- Vulnerability/writing
- The difference between a personal site and social networks
- Working alone on a project
- Notes on the Kindle (and how this thing is bad at books but great at something else)
