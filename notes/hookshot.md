[Hookshot.app](https://hookshot.app/) is real good. I picked it up last night and it matches my mental model for how I want to manage windows on my desktop. Throw that app up there, throw this one down there. Get back to work.

I think Hookshot is the kind of app that I’ll use it every day ten million times but will probably forget the name of it after a couple of months. Hookshot will become so engrained into how I use macOS until it feels like it’s part of the operating system itself.

And that’s the sign of some mighty fine software, if you ask me.
