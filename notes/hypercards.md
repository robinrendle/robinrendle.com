The other day I faffed about [with stacked cards on the web](https://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/JjXddMM) and came up with a somewhat interesting demo that [I then wrote about](https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass) for CSS-Tricks. Basically the jist is that position sticky is one of those CSS kickflips that is constantly forcing me to rethink things:

<p class="codepen" data-height="500" data-theme-id="20935" data-default-tab="result" data-user="robinrendle" data-slug-hash="JjXddMM" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em; margin-bottom:40px;" data-pen-title="Stacked Cards: Horizontal">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle/pen/JjXddMM">
  Stacked Cards: Horizontal</a> by Robin Rendle (<a href="https://codepen.io/robinrendle">@robinrendle</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

To do something like this not so long ago would’ve required a mountain of JavaScript. Also I had one demo—which I’ve now lost—where you could scroll within these cards. It would be pretty nifty for a portfolio or if you wanted to show a collection of books on a webpage and I’m sure there’s a million other nifty things you could do with this idea.
