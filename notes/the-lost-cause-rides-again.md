  "“The symbols point to something Confederate’s creators don’t seem to understand—the
  war is over for them, not for us.”"

[Ta-Nehisi Coates on the American Civil War](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/no-confederate/535512/) and _Confederate_, the new tv show by HBO:

> For while the Confederacy, as a political entity, was certainly defeated, and chattel slavery outlawed, the racist hierarchy which Lee and Davis sought to erect, lives on. It had to. The terms of the white South’s defeat were gentle. Having inaugurated a war which killed more Americans than all other American wars combined, the Confederacy’s leaders were back in the country’s political leadership within a decade. Within two, they had effectively retaken control of the South.
>
> Knowing this, we do not have to wait to point out that comparisons between _Confederate_ and _The Man in the High Castle_ are fatuous. Nazi Germany was also defeated. But while its surviving leadership was put on trial before the world, not one author of the Confederacy was convicted of treason. Nazi Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was hanged at Nuremberg. Confederate General John B. Gordon became a senator. Germany has spent the decades since World War II in national penance for Nazi crimes. America spent the decades after the Civil War transforming Confederate crimes into virtues. It is illegal to fly the Nazi flag in Germany. The Confederate flag is enmeshed in the state flag of Mississippi.
