Austin riffed on that bit I wrote about how [blogging is pointing at things and falling in love](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/8907d5a1-bc42-4a51-a1fb-19e0af6f40ec)—but!—he takes it one step further when he writes what [good writing is](https://austinkleon.com/2021/02/16/pointing-at-things/):

> Point at things, say, “whoa,” and elaborate.

Gosh I love that. And I think I’ve been darting around this question for [a while now](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/indeterminacy):

All that stuff is me pointing at me, pointing at a thing. But we should just get out of the way of the thing we’re pointing at!

Just point at things, say “whoa,” and elaborate. I gotta remember that.
