Nicholas Rougeux made this [wonderful archive of Metra train tickets](https://www.c82.net/metratickets/) from Chicago, and it reaches back more than 50 years. Nicholas just [updated the gallery](https://www.c82.net/blog/?id=93), making it easier to navigate and what not and so I’m embarrassed I’ve never seen this lovely thing before!

I love the designs from back in the 70s like [this one](https://www.c82.net/metratickets/#tickets-1346) or [this one](https://www.c82.net/metratickets/#tickets-1369). That colorful overlay style will make me weak in the knees.
