  "How are these words delivered to you? Massive networks of wires! Fiber-optic
  undersea cables line all the oceans and seas and grip the Earth like a hairnet.
  A single cable crossing an ocean costs hundreds of millions of dollars to install.
  Imagine the slowly plodding boats, embedding these cables into the seabeds. Who
  captains these vessels? Who turns the crank releasing more cable to the depths.
  Who prepares the pork and beans? "

Chris messed around with a famous essay by Leonard E. Read called [I, Pencil](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/I,_Pencil) and I love it so much:

> How are these words delivered to you? Massive networks of wires! Fiber-optic undersea cables line all the oceans and seas and grip the Earth like a hairnet. A single cable crossing an ocean costs hundreds of millions of dollars to install. Imagine the slowly plodding boats, embedding these cables into the seabeds. Who captains these vessels? Who turns the crank releasing more cable to the depths. Who prepares the pork and beans? Who scrapes the barnacles from the boats hull? These legions are among my antecedents. [...] Bask in a traceroute, a pale visualization of a journey through our vast network.
