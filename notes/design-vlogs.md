The pandemic has made a lot of things harder and so instead of setting up big meetings full of people to discuss design ideas, what I’m trying this week is something new: design vlogs.

I’ve been making videos of myself talking through a problem, giving all the necessary context, and then showing the design I want to pitch to the team. With the help of [mmhmm](https://www.mmhmm.app), I can record sketches from my iPad, switch to my desktop’s version of Figma with a click and then walk through the hi-fi mockups. It’s a great setup and for the first time in a long while I feel like I’m doing the _design_ part of design and not just worrying about visual niceties.

I hope that these videos will help people manage their time better and so they don’t have to drop everything for this one big meeting. They can grab lunch whilst listening to me rant or even treat it like a podcast.

But also this is an archive of everything I’m working on and what I’m thinking about at the moment. We’ll see if it helps my team get on the same page but I reckon it’s going to be wonderful to be able to go back and say “ah, yes. I had this all wrong. And this is the moment I realized...”
