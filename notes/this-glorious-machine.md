I just hit the publish button on a new story all about technology, e-bikes, and the future. Here, look:

I got an e-bike about a year ago and made a draft of this story immediately. But boy oh boy did this thing took a long while to get into a readable state. All my feelings were messy and complicated and as I used my e-bike I realized that the city of San Francisco itself—and its relationship to technology—has failed us. We’re a town producing mostly junk but e-bikes show us a way out.

E-bikes show us what technology should strive to be and where all our work should eventually lead.
