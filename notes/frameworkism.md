[Alex Russell](https://infrequently.org/2024/11/if-not-react-then-what/):

> Frameworkism is now the dominant creed of frontend discourse. It insists that all user problems will be solved if teams just framework hard enough. This is non-sequitur, if not entirely backwards. In practice, the only thing that makes web experiences good is caring about the user experience â€” specifically, the experience of folks at the margins. Technologies come and go, but what always makes the difference is giving a toss about the user.
