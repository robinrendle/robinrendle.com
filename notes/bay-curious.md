I love [Bay Curious](https://www.kqed.org/podcasts/baycurious). I’ve been listening to it for the last few weeks as I make my way down the Secret Coffee Corridor and then trek up and over Holly Park for coffee each morning. And sure, I’ve never really listened to a podcast about the city I live in or been a fan of local radio before, but Bay Curious ticks all the boxes for a Very Good Thing; it’s got that early-morning-electricity, that heck-yeah-let’s-go-rambunctiousness. It’s just the sort of deliriously enthusiastic stuff that I need right now.

If you live in the Bay Area and feel like you want to be closer to this beautiful, broken, weirdo town, then I’d highly recommend giving it a whirl.
