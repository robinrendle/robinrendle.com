In _[Letter from a Drowned Canyon](https://story.californiasunday.com/drowned-canyon)_ Rebecca Solnit marks a super interesting distinction between being a _conservationist_ and being an _environmentalist_:

> In the late 1950s, the news about radioactive fallout across the United States from the aboveground nuclear tests at the Nevada site was one reminder of systemic connection; pesticides were another. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book, _Silent Spring_, made it clear that our modern poisons spread beyond the places to which they were applied and ended up in us as well as in wilderness. What you did here mattered there. When you switch from thinking about protecting particular places to address the interconnectedness of all things, you turn from a conservationist into an environmentalist.
