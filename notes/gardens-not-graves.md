  "“...for years, we’ve neglected the disciplines of stewardship—the invisible
  and unglamorous work of collecting, restoring, safekeeping, and preservation. Maybe
  the answer isn’t to post more, to add more and more streams. Let’s return to our
  existing content and make it more durable and useful.”"
