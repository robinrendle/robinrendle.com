My favorite writing app has just been updated to include tags that you write just like a hashtag in a document, such as `#design`. Then all of your tags are organized and can easily be found for later. I’m not sure how useful this will be for archiving or writing but I love the enthusiasm of Oliver Reichenstein in [the announcement post](https://ia.net/writer/blog/write-to-organize):

> After a couple of weeks with tags, I don’t know what-what I’d do without them. More folders? Nah. Suddenly I need much fewer folders to keep things in order. Especially on small touch devices tags are a blessing. Just tag it. If you feel like it, you can order it on a point and click device later. Being able to write tags from within the documents completely changes the game.
