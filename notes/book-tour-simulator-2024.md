Here’s a fantastic essay by Sloan all about the tour for his latest novel [Moonbound](https://bookshop.org/p/books/wizard-s-design-robin-sloan/20374751) (I’m reading it right now and I love it to bits). [Robin writes](https://www.robinsloan.com/tap/tour/):

> The venue for SF in SF is the American Bookbinders Museum, where beautiful old machines are lined up in the shadows. These used to be the highest tech. The first time you visited, half of the city's crystal towers—those shining precipitations of Silicon Valley wealth—weren't built yet. 

And and and:

> Everywhere, there is kindness.
