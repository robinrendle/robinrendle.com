[Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/unified-theory-of------):

> This is one of my answers to the question of, why give a fuck about work? Why love your work? It won’t, of course, [love you back](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/work-wont-love-you-back). It can’t. Work isn’t a thing that can love. It isn’t alive, it isn’t and won’t ever be living. And my answer is: don’t.
