I’m starting a newsletter called [Flotsam, Jetsam, Lagan and Derelict](https://tinyletter.com/robinrendle) where I’ll begin to publish a short story once every other week. This is a place to help me learn how to write dialogue and think about character development and encourage me to write a little more.

The name of this series comes from the [nautical terms for shipwrecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flotsam,_jetsam,_lagan,_and_derelict) as I like the metaphor in comparison. These will be notes that I’ve revived from the depths of my drafts folder – some of them are bound to be messy but there’ll always be a little _something_ about them that’s worth investigating further.
