extract: Comic books as type specimens!

DJR just released [Indoor Kid](https://djr.com/notes/indoor-kid-font-of-the-month), a new variable font for typesetting dialogue in comic books and there’s a bunch of lovely things to note about it. First, I love the idea of a type specimen being a comic book! Second, having an emphasis slider sounds neat as hell:

> Ellis also requested a custom Emphasis axis that would make it easier for letterers to enlarge and vertically center words or phrases within a block of text. This is a longstanding comic book practice, especially for Bold Italic text. With conventional fonts, it can involve a lot of tedious adjustments to font size, baseline position, and leading. But with a variable font, it’s a quick flick of a slider, and the letters grow from the center as the stroke weight is maintained throughout.

Also, I totally missed David’s previous entry in Font of the Month, [Daily Special](https://djr.com/notes/februarys-font-of-the-month-more-daily-special). It’s just so, so good.
