I definitely broke the RSS feed with this but I finally moved all my posts into Astro, updated the images, rewrote basically every page and all the CSS from scratch, and managed to get it through my perhaps too complex build process.

It’s weird having a broken blog for two weeks. I feel this big chunk of me missing, a loss of _oomph!_ and _vroom!_ So I need to fix that.

But before I do, I need to fix my RSS feed.
