Man, it feels good to see Geoff back at [the helm over at CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-chronicles-xlii/):

> Remember these? Chris would write a post now and then to chronicle things happening around the ol’ CSS-Tricks site. [...] That’s why I thought I’d dust off the chronicles. It’s been a hot minute and a lot is happening around CSS-Tricks today.

This post made me audibly yahoo, so I’m most certainly rooting for Geoff and the gang, and I’m really excited where they take things in the future.
