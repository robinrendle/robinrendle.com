Here’s a [lovely monospaced font](https://departuremono.com/) by [Helena Zhang](https://www.helenazhang.com/) that’s worth checking out. It has just the right amount of charm and charisma, but it’s still readable at small sizes. I’m downloading this thing immediately.

Also:

> Departure Mono is a monospaced pixel font inspired by the constraints of early command-line and graphical user interfaces, the tiny pixel fonts of the late 90s/early 00s, and sci-fi concepts from film and television.

The ever-so-excellent website is by [Tobias Fried](https://tobiasfried.com/) and there are just so many details and animations and lovely bits of UI here. Right up to the end of the website where things usually trail off.

Extremely. Very. Good.
