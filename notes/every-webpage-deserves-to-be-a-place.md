Matt Webb just added a new feature to his website called [cursor party](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/05/cursor-party):

> If you’ve visited my actual website, rather than reading by email or whatever, such as reading [this very post](https://interconnected.org/home/2024/09/05/cursor-party), you may notice somebody else’s cursor pass by as you’re reading.

> [...] Mostly my blog is pretty quiet. I think of it like one of those always empty tiny galleries with like maximum three paintings that you get in some neighbourhoods (there’s one around the corner from where I live now in Peckham).
> 
> And if you’re in there - which is rare - and somebody else happens to step in at the exact same moment - which is super rare - then you’re like, huh, that’s nice, and you feel the cosy glow of co-presence and finish looking at the pictures then wander out again.

Cosy glow websites! Co-presence! A less lonely web!
