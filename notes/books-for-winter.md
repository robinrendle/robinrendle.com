extract: What is your favorite book to sit next to a fire with?
---

I’m running out of books, and I need your help. It looks like I’ll be spending Christmas alone here in San Francisco and so I need copious _distractions_.

So: what is your favorite winter book?

The sort of books that you associate most closely with the holidays and being wrapped up inside with? I guess the first book that comes to mind for some peculiar reason for me is _Lincoln in the Bardo_ by George Saunders. But there’s absolutely zero Christmas cheer to be found in that novel. Only sad ghosts and great writing.

So: send me a little email with your suggestion. Here’s the plan: I hereby announce the Robin Rendle Round Robin Reading Club where I’ll review the books you suggest. They can be anything at all, regardless of genre, but they have to feel somewhat Wintery.

Share away!
