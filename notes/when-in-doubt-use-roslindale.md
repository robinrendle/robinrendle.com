DJR has published a fantastic [reintroduction to Roslindale](https://djr.com/roslindale) that digs into the history behind the type family and why this style is still relevant today:

> Fonts are subject to fashion, they ebb and flow just like tastes in music and clothing. And while some things fade away forever, others are always waiting to return. In the late 1960’s, the charming faces from the early 1900s began to make a comeback. After years of modernist neutrality favored by the International Style, designers were on the hunt for dynamic, uneven typefaces that made them feel something.

(Having to stare at Inter all day long, I feel this eternal 1960s feeling in my bones.) 

This is simply fantastic work that goes without saying—but the one that really gets me is the Display ExtraLight variant of Roslindale. I can’t but help stop and stare at that one, it’s just been in a tab all morning and I keep peeking at it, as if it’ll somehow change or flitter away. So good.

Oh, and what fantastic design work behind the scenes here by [Typetura](https://typetura.com/), too!
