Mandy Brown wrote this fantastic piece about [building a space on the web for yourself](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/coming-home):

> A website is, among other things, a container. The shape of that container both constrains and makes possible what goes within it. This is, I think, one of the primary justifications for having your own website. Not just so you can own your stuff (for some meaning of “ownership,” in a culture in which any billionaire can scrape your work without permission and copyright only protects the rich). Not just so you have a home base among the shifting winds of the various platforms, which rise and fall like brush before the fire. Not just so you can avoid setting up camp in a Nazi bar. But also so that you can shape the work—so that you can give shape to it, and in that shaping make possible work that couldn’t arise elsewhere.

Yes, yes, yes! Websites have always been tiny mutinies, perfectly designed for rebellion! In these spaces we design the rules, we set the agenda. But perhaps what makes Mandy’s post so interesting to me is when she writes about difficulty. Often we want websites to be easy; we compare different content management systems and publishing workflows, we talk about how—with just a click!—a website can be made.

Instead, Mandy argues that building a personal space on the web should be difficult and how there’s something important to learn from that physical work:

> ...more often than not, I find that what I need is some friction, some labor, the effort to work things out. Efficiency is an anti-goal; it is at odds with the work, which requires resistance and tension in order to come into being.

I love this, of course, and the more I think about this it’s really how I’ve split my website between Notes and Essays. Notes are super easy to post and I’ve setup a macOS Shortcut that generates a markdown file with all the metadata for me so I can scribble ideas like a notepad. With Essays I’ve made them intentionally difficult because the difficulty is the point. I write all the HTML, CSS, and scripts by hand. And over the years I’ve found that this labor forces a project to slow way down, and for me to become much more considerate and careful than I otherwise would. Only then can I think deeply about details that I might skim over.

Efficiency be damned.
