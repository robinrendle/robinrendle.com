Kelly Sutton on [why his team views big front-end frameworks as a liability](https://kellysutton.com/2025/01/18/moving-on-from-react-a-year-later.html):

> Maybe it’s the changing interest rates or political winds, but I think the “fat client” era JS-heavy frontends is on its way out. The hype around edge applications is misplaced and unnecessary for building many different flavors of successful businesses.

My translation here: what’s good for business often isn’t what’s cool or tracking at the top of the orange website or what has most likes on GitHub. A product can be _extremely_ useful and interesting and still be on the most boring tech stack imaginable.

But also, this bit:

> Change comes with risk, and changing untested code has a higher regression risk. [...] Moving more slowly is fine in many cases. But when compared to a world where that change isn’t risky (server-rendered ERB), we are suddenly paying a very pricey tax for making changes in JavaScript.

At most places I’ve worked at, any amount of change feels _extremely_ risky and that sentiment at one point or another moves out of the codebase and into every meeting and discussion. So I think that as a small dev team, where every moment is precious, perhaps the most important thing is reliability in a codebase.

And big, overly complicated JS-heavy frontends are anything but reliable.
