I don’t know if this is a trend or anything but I like the idea of this: keyboard-first apps. Chris shared [Godspeed](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/03/23/11181/), a todo list app, that has a “hardcore mode” that disables the mouse so you can get used to the keyboard shortcuts even faster. But the whole product is designed around the keyboard.

I also spotted [Retina Studio](https://retina.studio/) the other day that has the same kinda philosophy with their apps [TextBuddy](https://retina.studio/textbuddy/) and [Fastmarks](https://retina.studio/fastmarks/) which is “100% keyboard-driven.”
