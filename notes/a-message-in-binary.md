Nolen Royalty writes about his wondrous [One Million Checkboxes](https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/) project, and how [something very peculiar happened](https://eieio.games/essays/the-secret-in-one-million-checkboxes/):

> A few days into making One Million Checkboxes I thought I’d been hacked. What was that doing in my database?
> 
> A few hours later I was tearing up, proud of some brilliant teens.
> 
> [...] I hadn’t been hacked.
> 
> Someone was writing me a message in binary.

Nolen also gave a fantastic talk at XOXO last week where he told a part of this story and I think it was one of the most inspiring talks I’ve seen in a while. It took every ounce of effort in me not to run back to my hotel room and hurriedly build something out of pure excitement.
