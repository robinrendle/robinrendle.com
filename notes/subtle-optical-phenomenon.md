In a post I wrote a while back about [dark mode and variable fonts](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/), Gerhard Großmann made this rather lovely comment:

> In typography it’s well known that luminous letters on dark backgrounds tend to look bolder. Unfortunately I know the technical term only in German – „Überstrahlung“, which could be translated as blooming or flare. If somebody knows the English term, please comment! I found a good explanation of this effect in a German article about legibility on computer screens. My translation of the relevant part: “Bright areas outshine (flare/bloom into) darker ones, so that a bright background eats away dark letters from the outside and the font seems to be less bold – vice versa bright text seems to be bolder on dark backgrounds.” Besides on computer screens this effect occurs on luminous or reflective road signage, too \[...]. It’s also helpful to slightly (!) letter-space white text on black backgrounds. As always in typography there’s more than one possibility to compensate the numerous subtle optical phenomenons.

_Subtle. Optical. Phenomenons._ Heck yes.
