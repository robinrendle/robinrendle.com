extract:
  "“I’m familiar with the re-write. This was more like starting a new book
  every four months or so. The number of plotlines and their interactions meant a
  kind of exponential multiplication of possibility. I’d made a maze in my own mind
  and I kept getting lost in it. The book was smarter than I was.”"

Nick Harkaway on [the experience of writing his latest novel](http://www.nickharkaway.com/regarding-gnomon/):

> This was like weaving a tapestry thread by thread while holding the entire design in your head, and my head just wasn’t big enough. Meanings intersected with other meanings, with consequences. I had to go back, again and again, re-work, re-conceive, re-imagine. Sure, yeah, I know: writing is re-writing. I’m familiar with the re-write. This was more like starting a new book every four months or so. The number of plotlines and their interactions meant a kind of exponential multiplication of possibility. I’d made a maze in my own mind and I kept getting lost in it. The book was smarter than I was.
