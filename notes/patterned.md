[Patterned](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patterned/id1451427298) is great. It's an iOS light puzzle game with soft piano in the background which makes it the perfect thing to play in bed. I've watched Celine play it the last few nights and it's so dang soothing.

(This is an endorsement of the game part of this app though and not the typography because it is very Lobster-inspired and dang that's not something that matches the tone or feel of the game parts at all.)
