> ...as a scientist and an explorer I have a duty to bear witness to the Splendours of the World. [...] The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite.

Okay, that quote likely doesn’t mean anything to you but regardless of that, you just gotta read _[Piranesi](https://bookshop.org/p/books/piranesi-susanna-clarke/15861178)_ by Susanna Clarke. I won’t spoil anything about it except to say that it’s the first book in a while that’s so thoroughly hooked me from beginning to end. 

In fact I refuse to tell you anything about the plot, the characters, or the setting. And boy do I want to! I could ramble endlessly about how the central mystery of the story is never revealed, or how the novel is as concise as possible. 

_Piranesi_ is so very good. It made my head spin. You must read it.
