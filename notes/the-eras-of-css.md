  "Without them, I wouldn’t be a designer."
---

I wouldn’t have become a designer if it wasn’t for CSS3 and HTML5. They came together at _just_ the right time and captured everything that was so exciting about publishing and typography on the web. And I was drawn towards the web because of this groundswell of excitement.

Now that I think of it, there’s a few reasons why I support big X.X releases for CSS and HTML. First, because it’s a great marketing campaign for bringing in new designers and folks who might be interested in making things for the web. Second, I reckon it helps combat the eternal silliness of “full-stack” engineering and folks looking down their noses at the front-end. Third, I think it helps teach these new features and reduces the stress of having to keep up to date on every new feature that ships.

I read a note the other day from an engineer who described their feelings of anxiety and being completely overwhelmed by the flurry of new CSS features. I get this! But I reckon if you package those features up it becomes easier to let everyone know that, yes, these features are ready to go and are a substantial upgrade that are worth taking the time to learn all in one go.

Even if the numbers are a bit arbritrary, their impact surely ain’t.
