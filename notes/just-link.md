Sloan explains why his newsletter is [just a link](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/just-link/) to a post on his website:

> My enthusiasm for the approach is related to my enthusiasm for the potential of the web page circa 2021. Typography, layout, inline interaction… a bunch of things have finally clicked into place, and it’s honestly a joy these days to make a web page. (Note that I said “web page,” not “web app.” Whole different situation.) Was it absolutely necessary for the illustration in this post to be a live 3D animation, three.js happily chugging along? No. Do I think it’s cool that it is? Yes!

I like this approach a whole lot.

Newsletters are still a very good thing but there is a samey-ness that I’ve noticed. I see this as the Radiolab Effect: a very popular format takes hold of the medium until everyone thinks that’s the only way to make a podcast/website/whatever. They think that a podcast can be nothing more than that _dog woofing, leaf crunching, old dude: “there’s a lot of mysterious stuff going on in this town, and I always knew it” train sounds “Eerie, Wyoming is only a six hour train ride from the nearest pub, and it’s home to just one resident...” more barking, more leaf crunching, man wheezing sounds ”...Peter.”_ kind of format.

Newsletters have their format now and what I love about Sloan’s just-throw-a-link-in-the-email approach is that it allows for variation and weirdness, or at least it feels like it has more potential than your typical friendly neighborhood newsletter.
