extract: "“Tell me about a complicated man.”"

The NYT has a great post about Emily Wilson’s [new translation of the Odyssey](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/the-first-woman-to-translate-the-odyssey-into-english.html), but here’s a snippet of the opening lines of the poem from [a real good thread](https://twitter.com/catacalypto/status/926359329887764481) that I can’t stop thinking about:

> Tell me about a complicated man.  
> Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost  
> when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,  
> and where he went, and who he met, the pain  
> he suffered in the storms at sea, and how  
> he worked to save his life and bring his men  
> back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,  
> they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god  
> kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,  
> tell the old story for our modern times.  
> Find the beginning.
