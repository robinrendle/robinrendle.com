I can’t stop thinking about this piece by [Jiayang Fan for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/chinas-selfie-obsession) all about obsession and celebrity worship and Chinese social networks:

One day, in a lottery, she won a ticket to see him in person. After agonizing for some time, she decided not to go. “I knew she wouldn’t go,” Wu said. “For her, this celebrity might as well have been a deity. You don’t want to come face-to-face with your god, because it’s frightening to think that you might see a pimple on his chin.
