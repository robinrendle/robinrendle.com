title: About Me

content: |

    I’m Robin, a writer and designer from the <span><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></span>. Currently I’m interning as a designer and front-end developer with the cool guys at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/) in Nottingham. This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web. 

    I think that personal websites like this should act as a workbench instead of a microphone and so all of the code, content and design material that I used to make this website is available to download from [Github](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com). You can tinker with the materials or just kick back and learn more about the process. In the spirit of working in public and to start things off, here’s the first of many documents to come that outline my thinking and design process; the [style guide](http://www.robinrendle.com/style-guide) of this very website.
