title: About Me

content: |

    I’m Robin, a writer and designer from the <span><abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr></span>. Currently I’m interning as a designer and front-end developer with the cool guys at [Erskine design](http://erskinedesign.com/) in Nottingham. This is where I [work in public](http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189), and try to wrap my head around the current state of publishing and the web.

    I think that personal websites like this should act as a workbench instead of a microphone and so all of the code, content and design material that I used to make this website is available to download from [Github](https://github.com/robinrendle/robinrendle.com). In the spirit of working in public and to start things off, here’s the first of many documents to come that outline my thinking and design process; the [style guide](http://www.robinrendle.com/style-guide) of this very website.
