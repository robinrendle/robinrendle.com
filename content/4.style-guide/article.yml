  This document contains all of the basic semantic elements and visual styles you might well find in a larger website, but this is a good place as any to start practicing the styling and development of a larger visual system. The basic typographic components, such as headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks, rules, blockquotes and figures, can be found below. Examples of each are placed within the <code>figure</code> element. Beneath is a how a contents navigational element should be styled.

  <nav class="contents">
    <h3 class="h5 contents">Contents</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#headings">Headings</a></li>
      <li><a href="#para">Paragraphs</a></li>
      <li><a href="#links">Links</a></li>
      <li><a href="#code">Code</a></li>
      <li><a href="#rule">Horizontal rule</a></li>
      <li><a href="#citation">Citing and referencing</a></li>
    </ol>
  </nav>

  <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
  All pages begin with a <code>h1</code> contained within a <code>header</code>. Additional information about the document, such as the time, location, comments or other such material about the document can be placed directly inside. 

  ## Level 2 heading
  The header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h1</code> header in a document hierarchy.

  ### Level 3 heading
  The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.

  #### Level 4 heading
  The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.

  ##### Level 5 heading
  The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.

  Often these headings will stand alone, but sometimes it might be necessary for multiple headings to be used at the same time. In this instance use the <code>hgroup</code> element. For styling purposes it’s also possible to add the <code class="class">.h1</code>, <code class="class">.h2</code>, <code class="class">.h3</code>, <code class="class">.h4</code>, <code class="class">.h5</code> classes to an element in order to give one heading the visual style of another.

  <figure class="example">
    <hgroup>
      <h2 class="h4">This is a level 2 heading</h2>
      <h3 class="h2">This is a level 3 heading</h3>
    </hgroup>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="para">Paragraphs</h3>
  All paragraphs of text are contained within <code>p</code> tags. This should only be for original content, otherwise <code>p</code> tags should always be contained within a <code>blockquote</code> when referring to another’s statement.

  <h3 id="links">Links</h3>
  Links to websites or sections of the current page should be marked up with the <code>a</code> element. Links employ the primary color used across the website and so this should likewise be chosen for other elements such as buttons, banners or graphics.

  <figure class="example">
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcQKtl3MGCE">This song by Johnny Cash</a>, called <cite>A Boy Named Sue</cite>, is kinda punk rock.</p>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="code">Code</h3>
  The <code>code</code> element is used whenever a fragment of computer code is referenced. For longer sections, place code within the <code>pre</code> element. Use this element elsewhere when displaying text with unusual formatting, such as a type specimen or some sort of computer output.

  <figure class="example">
    <pre><code>section {
      color:$branding;
      font-size: 1.3em;
    }</code></pre>
  </figure>

  If there are any larger, unique code samples that are necessary then use an inline <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> for later reuse and reference (and to make it easier for others to fix bugs). For computer output, such as when the screen screamed <samp>Ouch! Press 3 for less noise</samp>, do not use <code>code</code> but <code>samp</code> instead. Likewise, to denote user input on a keyboard, the <code>kbd</code> element should be used in this instance. 

  <figure class="example">
  To make the application window fill half of the screen space, press <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>⌥ Alt</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>. 
  </figure>

  <h3 id="rule">Horizontal rule</h3>

  The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. This small quote from <cite>Kokoro</cite> by the <a href="http://www.wabisabi-press.co.uk/">Wabi Sabi Press</a> is an example of when to use such a rule:

  <figure class="example">
    I wish the paper of my shōji could have been, like a photographic plate, sensitive to that first delicious impression cast by a level sun. I am already regretting distortions: the beautiful silhouette has begun to lengthen.
    <hr>
    Of all peculiarly beautiful things in Japan, the most beautiful are the approaches to high places of worship or of rest, – the Ways that go to Nowhere and the Steps that lead to Nothing.
  </figure>

  <h3 id="citation">Citing and referencing</h3>
  To highlight the title of a film, a newspaper, a book or an essay use the <code>cite</code> element. There doesn’t seem to be much consensus about how to properly cite a text with basic <span>html</span> yet and, although I’ve looked at this semantic problem a lot, it seems that things are still in an awful <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4675/">state of flux</a>. Here is an example of how this site will be referencing a text for the time being:

  <figure class="example"><p>F.Scott Fitzgerald, <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite>, Wordsworth Classics, London, 1993.</p></figure>

  In other instances it might be best to quote a passage of text inline or in the middle of a sentence. The <code>q</code> element can be used to  do so, for example:

  <figure class="example">
    <p><q>Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,</q> he told me, <q>just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.</q> He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way.</p>
  </figure>

  For regular passages of text that need citation, the <code>figure</code> element should be used to contain both the <code>blockquote</code> element (the quotation or excerpt) and the <code>footer</code> element (for referencing the original author/location). Make sure that <code>cite</code> is used to reference the title and a link to the original is available. If this is not possible then make sure that the page number, author, edition and publisher is cited correctly. The margins between the text and the citation is half that of the regular margins (to preserve loveliness):

  <figure class="example">
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet<br>
        Compulsion thus transported to forget<br>
        What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope<br>
        Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste<br>
        Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,<br>
        Save what is in destroying, other joy<br>
        To me is lost.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="cite">
      <p>John Milton, <cite><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/pl/book_9/text.shtml">Paradise Lost</a></cite></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  ### Defining terms
  The <code>dfn</code> tag is used for indicating a definition or a word used for the first time. The <code>title</code> attribute can be used for highlighting an <dfn title="Pungent, angry and bitter">acrimonious</dfn> description. Likewise the <code>abbr</code> tag is used to describe abbreviations such as <span><abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">Nato</abbr></span> or <span><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></span>.

  ### Superscript and subscript numbers
  The <code>sub</code> tag defines subscript text that should appear half a character below the baseline. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, such as H<sub>2</sub>O. Likewise, the <code>sup</code> tag defines superscript text and should appear half a character above the baseline. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, such as WWW <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>.

  <h3>Highlighted Text &amp; Emphasis</h3>
  The <code>mark</code> element is used to represent a run of text marked or highlighted for reference purposes. Within a body of text, <mark>highlighted sections will always appear like this</mark>, so expect these yellow scribbles all over the place.

  The <code>em</code> element is intended for emphasis, or for words that ought to be <em>stressed differently</em>. On the other hand, <code>i</code> should be used for transliterated foreign words, technical terms, and typographically italicized text. <i>Oui, c’est le vie</i>.

  ### Retracted text
  The <code>del</code> element is used for retracted text, whilst <code>ins</code> is used for the replacement. Furthermore, the <code>datetime</code> within each element should specify the time of deletion and creation.
  
  <figure class="example">
    When I came back from the <del datetime="2012-12-28">East last autumn</del> <ins datetime="2012-12-28">West last spring</ins> I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever.</p>
  </figure>

  For representing content that is no longer valid though, use the <code>s</code> element. This is for document <s>reddits</s> edits only.

  ### Time
  The <code>datetime</code> element is used to denote the time of certain elements. For material that is published and dated here, use the <code>pubdate</code> attribute in order to identify the time as the publication date.

  <figure class="example">
    <p><cite>Moby-Dick; or, The Whale</cite> is a novel by Herman Melville, first published on the <datetime="1851-10-18">18th October 1851</date>.</p>
  </figure>

  <h3>Strong importance</h3>
  The <code>strong</code> element is used to highlight text that has a higher semantic importance than the surrounding text. If a word should simply be stylisticly heavier then the <code>b</code> element should be used instead. Small caps can be used with the <code>span</code> element for purely stylistic, yet <span>deliciously crunchy</span> reasons.</dd>

  <figure class="example">
    <p><span>And, after boasting</span> this way of my tolerance, <b>I wanted no more riotous excursions</b> with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction.
  </figure>

  <h3>Figure element</h3>
  Images are always marked up with <code>figure</code>, captions with <code>figcaption</code>. Not every image needs a description or a heading but this might sometimes help clarify the reason why the image was included. Multiple elements can be placed within a figure, in which case the <code>img</code> element will automatically add extra margins to compensate.

  <figure class="example">
    <img alt="all teh kittys" src="http://placekitten.com/g/800/450">
    <figcaption>
      <h5>Super amazing kitteh</h5>
      Cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="example">
    <iframe class="map" frameBorder='0' src='http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/robinrendle.map-be54lp9e.html#4/53.11/2.0100000000000304'></iframe>
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  ### Forms and Labels
  For information that needs to be collected from the user, such as comments, names or addresses, use the <code>fieldset</code> element. Each form requires a separate <code>label</code> that is styled similarly to the <code>h3</code> heading.

  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Legend</legend>
      <div>
        <label for="text">Text input</label>
        <input class="text" type="text">
        <em>Note about this field</em>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="text">Something something</label>
        <input class="text" type="text">
        <em>Note about this field</em>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="url">Web address</label>
        <input id="url" class="text" type="url">
        <em>Note about this field</em>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="email">Email address</label>
        <input id="email" class="text" type="email">
        <label class="error">This field is required.</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input id="search" class="text" type="search" placeholder="Search">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="textarea">Textarea</label>
        <textarea id="textarea" rows="8" cols="48"></textarea>
        <div class="submit">
          <input class="button" type="submit" value="Post">
        </div>
      </div>
    </fieldset>
  </form>

  ### Tables
  Tabular data should be placed within a <code>table</code>. The <code>thead</code> and <code>tbody</code> elements can be used to separate the sections of the table. At the end a <code>caption</code> can be used in order to further identify the presented data. Unfortunately this element is not suitably responsive, as I dislike many of the current styling methods for doing so.

  <figure class="example">
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredients</th>
            <th>Serves 12</th>
            <th>Serves 24</th>
            <th>Price (in $)</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>A cornicopia of vegetables</td>
          <td>1 quart</td>
          <td>2 quart</td>
          <td>13</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Vanilla extract</td>
          <td>13 spoons</td>
          <td>14 spoons</td>
          <td>750,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Milk</td>
          <td>1 quart</td>
          <td>2 quart</td>
          <td>67</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </figure>

  ### Lists
  The <code>ul</code> element can be used for an unordered, bulletted list. Items within these elements are enclosed by a series of <code>li</code> elements. Here is an example of a list:

  <figure class="example">
    <ul>
      <li>This is an unordered list item</li>
      <li>
        This is the second unordered list item
          <ul>
            <li>This can also contain an unordered list within</li>
            <li>This particular element has two children</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>This is the third unordered list item</li>
    </ul>
  </figure>

  Ordered lists are marked up with <code>ol</code> and also contain <code>li</code> elements. Lists can contain sublists within them that might describe one particular <code>li</code> in further detail.

  <figure class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>This is a list item</li>
      <li>
        This is a list item
          <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered secondary list within</li>
            <li>This parent has three children</li>
            <li>Some of which <a href="http://www.rdio.com/artist/Grimes/album/Visions/">contain links</a></li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      <li>This is a list item</li>
    </ol>
  </figure>

  The <code>dl</code>, or definition list, generally consists of a series of term/definition pairs instead of list items. This can be used to define a term but it can also be used to denote any parent/child relationship, for example an interview, with the <code>dt</code> element containing the person’s name and the <code>dd</code> element beneath containing their quote.

  <figure class="example">
    <dl>
      <dt>Homeland</dt>
      <dd>A television show about terrorists.</dd>
      <dt>Vision</dt>
      <dd>An awesome album by Grimes, a band I'm currently listening to.</dd>
      <dt>Plymouth</dt>
      <dd>A city that lies in the south west of England.</dd>
      <dt>James Gleick</dt>
      <dd>The network has a structure, and that structure stands upon a paradox. Everything is close, and everything is far, at the same time. This is why cyberspace can feel not just crowded but lonely. You can drop a stone into a well and never hear a splash.
    </dl>
  </figure>

  ### Copyright and disclaimers
  The <code>small</code> element is used to denote legal restrictions, notices, side comments, disclaimers, caveats, and small print. For example:

  <figure class="example">
    <small>Copyright © 2011-2012. Orsen Welles. All Rights Reserved.</small>
  </figure>

  That about wraps it up for this small style guide. Thanks to <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/downloads/markupguide/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/">Paul Robert Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://karenmcgrane.com/">Karen McGrane</a> for inspiring me to do this. I’m sure the site will be more flexible, efficient and useful in the long term thanks to defining these essential, yet basic characteristics and styles from the offset.
