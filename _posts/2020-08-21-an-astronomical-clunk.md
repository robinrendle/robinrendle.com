extract: That feeling of writing, designing, and building a website.

Sometimes I forget how truly bonkers the web is. Most of the time I’m clicking around, bored out of my mind, watching this blur of links and code and words and screaming. I’ve seen it all. 

But then there’s the other times. The ones where I have an idea and jot it down with Codepen, grab the link, and send it to someone instantly. It’s the sort of moment where the original promise of the web is made true; the hope that all this technology— the pipes, the web standards, and the browser itself—could expand, could improve our lives and the way we think. It’s a moment when all those pieces of all that infrastructure aligns like stars in the sky. 

And then _clunk_! fits into place.

When people ask me what I do for a living, “web designer” is the obvious answer. But that doesn’t really sound like a job anymore. “Product designer” is what folks out here call it but I don’t really care about apps or software—I care about all those stars aligning, that astronomical _clunk_-ing. That feeling when the acts of writing, designing, and building a website becomes indistinguishable from one another. And so when people ask me what I do, I want to talk about that _clunk_ feeling but lack the vocabulary to explain it properly.

But it’s what I want to contribute to. It’s how I want everyday to feel like.
