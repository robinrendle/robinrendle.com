[Chris mentioned Setapp](https://chriscoyier.net/2020/10/21/setapp/) the other day and when I checked out [the website](https://setapp.com/) I scoffed a little bit because it seemed too good to be true. The idea is this: for $9.99 a month you get access to a library of Mac apps and that initially felt like a weird scam to me because after looking around I spent my entire evening last night going through the archive and installed all this in one go: 

- [Gifox](https://setapp.com/apps/gifox) to make gifs, which I do every day for design work and writing newsletters.
- [iStat Menus](https://setapp.com/apps/istat-menus) for seeing how my laptop is doing.
- [Paste](https://setapp.com/apps/paste) stores my clipboard history and I had no idea how dang useful that would be.
- [CleanMyMac X](https://setapp.com/apps/cleanmymac) scans my laptop and deletes garbage that I don’t need.
- [TextSniper](https://setapp.com/apps/textsniper) lets you take a screenshot of some text and then it’ll run some OCR magic on it and add that text to your clipboard. 

I’m sure there’s other apps I’ll find but this has already been worth the price of admission alone.
