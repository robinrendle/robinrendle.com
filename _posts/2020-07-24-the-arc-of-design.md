In any game you’ll spot it. Equip an object like a grenade or a stone—anything you want to throw at an enemy—and you’ll see the arc: dotted lines revealing the path that the object will take. Pretty much every game uses this visual trick for two reasons; first, because perceiving depth in a three-dimensional game is difficult (this is why Nintendo de-emphasized perfectly timed jumps in *Mario 64* onwards and it’s why in the 2D platformer *Super Meat Boy* the developers can get away with pixel-perfect jumping precision). But second, this throwing-arc is important because, well... 

Great interface design is about seeing the future. 

Not so long ago there was a bug in the game I was playing where the throwing arc became invisible. But I didn’t notice it was missing at all, one day I just found that my accuracy was now terrible. I was throwing grenades ten, twenty feet off the mark each time and I kept blaming myself for being lazy or bad. It took me weeks to realize what the problem was and, sure enough, a patch released that fixed the issue and I could suddenly throw things properly again. It wasn’t me—it was the design!

Since that throwing-arc mysteriously disappeared I’ve thought a lot about what this means for my job as a designer and how I might alleviate someone’s anxiety about the future; *what happens when I click this? Or what if I go here, select this thingy and move it over there? What does this mean? Who is that? Also: why??? What impact will this button have on my data? Where am I going? How will this decision hurt me or help me?*

The throwing-arc mechanic that we see in pretty much every game answers one of these questions (or existential anxieties) elegantly. What will happen when I press this button and throw this thing? *Well*, the throwing arc says, *if you click this button then this precise thing will happen this far away.* Sometimes a game will show how much damage this will do—great for RPGs when you often need to calculate turns and percentages, hit points, MP and ammo.

Another example can be found in _The Ghost of Tsushima_: in many large-scale free-roam games you will have a map dotted with markers and it’s always visible in the bottom left of your screen. Some have complained for years now that this brings you out of the stunning environment you find yourself in and you spend 90% of the time living inside this tiny map, figuring out where you need to go. 

But _The Ghost of Tsushima_ is quite different because there is no map. 

Instead, you must follow the wind; all the trees and flowers, the foxes and the birds, all of nature guides your progress to the next important thing. And I think this is the single most beautiful bit of design I’ve seen in quite some time because the world itself is showing me the future. This makes me closely watch the trees and the petals in the river, noticing the absolute wondrous beauty of this game’s environment design. But it alleviates the anxiety of that question: _where am I going now?_

This anxiety about the future is true outside of videogame design, too. It’s why we should label icons and provide folks with accessible interfaces. It’s why we should build clear hover and focus states that let someone sort of guess what will happen when they click something or when they type. It’s why we should write copy to prevent confusion about the terms of an agreement or the complexity of a feature. It’s why responsive design is important. It’s why good URL design is worthy of our time and attention.

And so I’m glad for the bug I came across that day because it re-framed my work. Or rather, clarified something that I’d been thinking about for a long time. All of these questions and anxieties are really comforting people in the face of an uncertain future; one wrong click, one poorly-timed refresh, and suddenly all your data is gone, you’ve sent an embarrassing message to someone, the interface has hurt you.

Perhaps our motto as designers should then be this: Do no harm. Make things clear. Show us the future.
