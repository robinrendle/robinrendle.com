Lucy sent me [Schemas of Uncertainty](http://schemasofuncertainty.com/) and I keep opening the tab, looking at it, and realizing that it needs far more of my attention and focus than I have left over right now. The homepage for _whatever_ this is is sort of remarkable:

As much as I like the design of this thing, I must say the writing makes my eye twitch: 

> Schemas of uncertainty as a proposition suggests a space of indeterminacy; a set of possible frameworks that allow the unintelligible to flow through them. Perhaps an introduction is all too fixingâ€”enacting a form of pre-emption of what is to come. Therefore, as a reader, you can treat this text as an invitation to move with us through some of the many possible links the contributions generate when read in relation to one another. 

This is reminds me of [Guy Debord](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/who-the-fuck-is-guy-debord). Ugh.
