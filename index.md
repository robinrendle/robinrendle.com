<p class="intro">I’m Robin, a British designer, writer, and typographic nuisance from San Francisco. This is where I make notes about my work and every once in a while publish more thoughtful stories.</p>

Today I’m a product designer at Retool. Previously I was a staff writer at CSS-Tricks where I wrote about the web and in the past I’ve also designed things at Sentry and Gusto, as well as for clients such as Buttondown and XOXO.
