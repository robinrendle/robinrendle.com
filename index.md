Howdy – Robin Rendle here. 

I’m a British software designer, writer, and typographic nuisance but for the last decade I’ve shuffled up and down the Bay Area, writing words and designing interfaces. Along the way I’ve worked with smart folks at [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/), [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), and [Retool](https://retool.com/) as well as for handsome clients like [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/).

Since the summer of 2025 I’ve been a software designer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com).

Way back in 2012 I got my MA in information design at Reading University (because I found that every book I read about typesetting thanked them in the intro). Somehow I managed to sneak in and I found precisely what I was looking for: the [Department of Typography and Graphic Communication](https://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/) is a typographic time machine. Every wall and cabinet drawer is filled to the brim with precious artifacts: metal type and wood engravings, type posters and famous Bauhaus treasures. It’s a special place, with some very special people.

After college I was a front-end engineer for a good long while. That led me to [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) where I was a staff writer from 2014–2022. Over the years I learned how to poke at words until they made sense and how to break up big concepts into teeny tiny interactive demos. Eventually I took the helm of the CSS-Tricks newsletter — my first beat — and it soon became a punk rock writer’s residency. Years later, and I’m still proud of the work we did together making that website, even if I only played a tiny role in it.

Since 2012 this website has been a blog—sure, yes—but I’ve always seen it as a humble printing press. Every week or so I’ll publish a note about what I’m reading and then about once a year I’ll publish a big [story](/stories). Think of these as condescending e-essays about whatever it is I’m currently obsessed with. This might be notes on typography, design systems, photography, or the magic of e-bikes but it’s often where I tend to push my web development and writing skills.

Today, if I tilt my head a bit, I see all this somewhat-unrelated work continuing the stuff I made as a kid; rolling around in the sun, making comic books for hours on end.

It’s all just publishing, man.
