Howdy – Robin here. 

I’m a British software designer, writer, and typographic nuisance but for the last decade I’ve shuffled up and down the Bay Area, writing words and designing interfaces. Along the way I’ve worked with smart folks at [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com/), [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), and [Retool](https://retool.com/) as well as for handsome clients like [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/). Today I’m a software designer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com).
