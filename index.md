<p class="intro">I’m Robin, a British designer, writer, and typographic nuisance from San Francisco. This is where I make <a href="/notes">notes</a> about my work and every once in a while publish more thoughtful <a href="/stories">stories</a>.</p>

Today I’m a product designer at [Retool](https://retool.com/). Previously I was a staff writer at [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) where I wrote about design engineering and in the past I’ve also made things at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) and [Gusto](https://gusto.com/), as well as for clients such as [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/) and [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/).
