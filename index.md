Howdy – Robin Rendle here.

I’m a software designer and for a decade now I’ve shuffled up and down the Bay Area, writing words and designing interfaces. Along the way I’ve worked for smart folks at Gusto, Sentry, and Retool as well as for handsome clients like XOXO and Buttondown.

Since the summer of 2025 I’ve been a designer at Apple.

From 2014–2022 I was a staff writer at CSS-Tricks. Over the years I learned how to poke at words until they made sense and how to break up big concepts into teeny tiny interactive demos. Eventually I took the helm of the CSS-Tricks newsletter — my first “beat” — and it soon became a punk rock writer’s residency. Years later, and I’m still proud of the work we did together making that website, even if I only played a tiny role in it.

Reading University is where I got my Masters in information design, but I snuck into every class about typography and letter-making that I could. For a kid who always wanted to be in publishing, the Department of Typography and Graphic Communication was like stumbling into a typographic time machine. Every wall and cabinet drawer is filled to the brim with precious artifacts: metal type and wood engravings, type posters and famous Bauhaus treasures. It was a special place for me, with some very special people.

Since 2012 this website has been a blog—sure, yes, okay—but I’ve always seen it as a printing press first. Every once in a while I’ll publish a story, think of these as big e-essays about whatever it is I’m currently obsessed with. This might be notes on typography, design systems, photography, or the magic of e-bikes.
