<p class="intro">Today I’m a designer at Apple. Previously I’ve designed software at Retool, Sentry, and Gusto as well as for clients like Buttondown and XOXO.</p>

I was a staff writer at CSS-Tricks where I wrote about the web, too. Prototypes! CSS! Complex layouts and design systems! For almost a decade I wrote about it all.

This website is where I’ve jotted down notes about my reading and what I’ve been working on. It’s also where I’ve learned to write and design, learning about typography and front-end code.

Every once in a while I tend to publish bigger, more thoughtful stories though too.

## Colophon

Body text is [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/) by Klim Type and I can’t think of anything else to read my words in. The ever-so-lovely headings are set in [Bradley](https://djr.com/notes/bradley-djr-font-of-the-month/) by David Jonathan Ross which have the perfect amount of charm.

Under the hood, everything is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which just happens to be my favorite tool for publishing websites.
