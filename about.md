<p class="intro">I’m Robin, a British designer, writer, and typographic nuisance from San Francisco. Today I’m a designer at <a href="https://apple.com">Apple</a> although previously I’ve made software at <a href="https://retool.com">Retool</a>, <a href="https://sentry.io">Sentry</a>, and <a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a> as well as for clients like <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> and <a href="https://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a>.</p>

For the best part of a decade I was a staff writer at [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) where I wrote about front-end development and UI engineering on the web. Prototypes! Accessibility! Complex layouts and design systems! Over the years I wrote about almost everything when it comes to making a website.

You can keep up with the notes and stories that I publish here [via RSS](/feed.xml) or through the extremely slow publishing schedule of the ol’ [newsletter](/newsletter/). You can also reach out via [Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@fonts), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/robinrendle.bsky.social), or <a href="mailto:robinjrendle@gmail.com?subject=Why%20Must%20You%20Disturb%20My%20Slumber">email</a>.

## Colophon

Body text is [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/) by Klim Type and I can’t think of anything else to read my words in. The ever-so-lovely headings are set in [Bradley](https://djr.com/notes/bradley-djr-font-of-the-month/) by David Jonathan Ross which have the perfect amount of charm.

Under the hood, everything is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which just happens to be my favorite tool for publishing websites.
