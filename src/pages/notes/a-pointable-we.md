extract:
  All I know is the more I read digitally, the more this feeling — the strange
  joy of adding to the corpus6 and seeing where it takes us — grows inside me, and
  I can't be the only one to feel this. Adding to the corpus — making things pointable
  — has become habitual, and aspects of it are becoming more and more passive. These
  habits and expectations aren't going anywhere.

I keep returning to Craig Mod’s fervent, potent ideas on what it means to be a part of the web, both as a citizen and as a large publisher:

> All I know is the more I read digitally, the more this feeling — the strange joy of adding to the corpus and seeing where it takes us — grows inside me, and I can't be the only one to feel this. Adding to the corpus — making things pointable — has become habitual, and aspects of it are becoming more and more passive. These habits and expectations aren't going anywhere.

I think this is why I have a certain amount of unease about Medium and writing for other spaces. Whenever I publish to my own little space on the web I get this feeling of adding to the greater corpus—no one might ever find it, no one might even ever read it (I removed Google analytics long, long ago so this might be the case), but linking to things still has a feeling of “a-ha! I see this!”
