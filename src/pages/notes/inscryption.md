Let me tell you of [_Inscryption_](https://www.inscryption.com/): The animations! The music! The card game that’s actually fun! The spookiness! The lore of each card in your deck! The thrill of _losing_ the game! Have I mentioned the music yet! I can’t hear you over all this wild, unbound enthusiasm! Sorry!

If I described the art style of this video game to you then you’d quickly reply: “Nah, mate. That doesn’t work.” But gosh darn, it _does_. _Inscryption_ somehow manages to blend a VHS/lo-fi aesthetic with all the spookiness and charm of the Brothers Grimm. If Little Miss Riding Hood entered the room shortly followed by Doom Guy then it would just...make sense somehow.

And I’m saying all of this as someone who can’t stand video games that are just about watching a pile of cards shuffle in a deck. What are those games even called? Those Hearthstone-esque games? Anyway, I loathe them because they bore me to tears but _Inscryption_ somehow drops all that baggage I have with the genre, leans in close, says something creepy in my ear about how you’re trapped in this room and if both candles are blown out then you die. And each time you lose the game and die, the story outside of the card game continues. The candles are re-lit. You start at the beginning. Don’t make the same mistake again or you’ll...well...you’ll have to see. 

Also: the animations! Can I tell you how much I hate animations generally? I think they mostly get in the way and almost always feel like bragging to me. Look what I can do with Framer Motion! Weeeeeee! It’s never really in service of the experience or the UI and often those animations end up slowing me down getting the information that I want. _Inscryption_ though has a shit ton of them. Animate all the things! But they don’t get in the way. Ever. It’s remarkable, and I don’t quite understand how they made the animations quite so lovely and yet not even remotely annoying once you’ve seen them a million times. 

And the music! Have I told you about the music!
