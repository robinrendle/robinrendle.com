> People are desperate for a way out, for something to belong to, for something to believe in. The future has always seemed to leave them behind. Crypto masquerades as a future of enrichment, selling a dream - that you, an individual, outsmarted the system and profited, that you found the same kind of loophole that you’ve heard the ultra-rich uses, one that allows you to feel as if you’re participating in a kind of counter-culture.

> Worse-still, there is an abundance of optimism in the face of imminent, obvious danger.
