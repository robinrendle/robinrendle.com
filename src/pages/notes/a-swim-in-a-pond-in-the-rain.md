I’ve been haunted by a question lately: how I could’ve kick-started my writing career? What if I read _these_ books sooner? What if I wrote every day? What if I didn’t get side-tracked with music or video games or—_oof_—friendship? 

This is all incorrect of course and perhaps the worst imaginable way to think about your career. It’s toxic and childish, for one. For second, it’s unkind to yourself. All those things could feed into your work, sure, maybe. But those things don’t exist _for_ your work, they can exist outside of it. My point here is: You can be happy and have a career that makes you proud of your work without having to lock yourself away in a room and abandon life in order to achieve it.

It’s still worried me though. Should I have taken a different degree in college? Should I have tried harder in high school to get into a better university where I could’ve met a teacher or a book or a _something_ that would speed up the process? And would I be a better writer—smarter, faster, kinder—if all that happened?

These thoughts have been tumbling around my noggin’ as I’ve been reading George Saunders’ _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_. It’s so impossibly good that it hurts deep down. In the book, Saunders takes a bunch of old Russian stories and then breaks them up, spreads them across a whiteboard and points at them in a way that doesn’t feel like literary criticism as I understand it. It feels—dare I say—fun.

Saunders looks at these stories and asks us to think about what makes up a story. Why is _that_ there? How does it make us feel? What do we know at this point in the story and where do you think it will lead next?  All of this is in service to become writers though:

> When I was a kid, Lipton had a TV commercial with the catchphrase “Is it soup yet?” 
> 
> We’re always asking, of a work we’re reading (even if it’s one of our own): “Is it a _story_ yet?” 
> 
> That’s the moment we’re seeking as we write. We’re revising and revising until we write the text up, so to speak, and it produces that “now it’s a story” feeling. 

I think that’s what was missing from the degrees I took. It always felt like we were judging Shakespeare, Milton, Orwell, or Austen, instead of asking: “How do we steal all this stuff? What’s the secret that we can decipher to make better sentences, better heroes, better stories?”

George continues: 

> We've said that a story is a system for the transfer of energy. Energy made in the early pages gets transferred along through the story, passed from section to section, like a bucket of water headed for a fire, and the hope is that not a drop gets lost.

George’s book makes me feel that this way of learning about stories—this way of talking about capital L literature and sentences and people—is what I needed sooner in my writing career.
