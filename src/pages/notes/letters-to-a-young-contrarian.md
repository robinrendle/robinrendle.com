Christopher Hitchens, [Letters to a Young Contrarian](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Letters-Young-Contrarian-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/0465030335):

> How to ward off atrophy and routine, you ask? Well, I can give you a small and perhaps ridiculous example. Every day, the <em>New York Times</em> carries a motto in a box on its front page. “All the News That’s Fit to Print,” it says. It’s been saying it for decades, day in and day out. I imagine that most readers of the canonical sheet have long ceased to notice this bannered and flaunted symbol of its mental furniture. I myself check every day to make sure that the bright, smug, pompous, idiotic claim is still there. Then I check to make sure it still irritates me. If I can still exclaim, under my breath, <em>why</em> do they insult me and <em>what</em> do they take me for and what <em>the hell</em> is it supposed to mean unless it’s as obviously complacent and conceited and censorious as it seems to be, then at least I know that I still have a pulse.

> You may wish to choose a more rigorous mental workout but I credit this daily infusion of annoyance with extending my life span.
