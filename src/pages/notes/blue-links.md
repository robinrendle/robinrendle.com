Imagine explaining to someone in the future that billions of dollars—and really the whole economy of the internet; publishing, advertising, books, music, video games, software, hardware, not to mention personal validation—all of it hinged on an endless war between people trying to make their blue link get to the top of a single web page. _The_ Web Page. 

Imagine telling that to your grandkids. 

I think it’s gonna sound *wild* to them.
