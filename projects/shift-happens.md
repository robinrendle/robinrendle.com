<p class="intro">Shift Happens is a book by Marcin Wichary about the history of keyboards—from the earliest typewriters to the latest pixellated pocket keyboards. I interviewed Marcin for the launch of his wildly successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mwichary/shift-happens">Kickstarter campaign</a>.</p>

My role here was simple: ask smart questions, look extremely handsome, and gasp at how punk rock his book had become after all these years. We discuss Marcin’s writing process and research as well as the smallest design details of the book.

Perhaps my favorite part of this conversation is towards the end when Marcin talks about the database of images, ephemera, and general typewriter information that he created to support his writing. It’s a fascinating look into what it takes to make a book on this scale, at this level, from a writer/designer who I admire so very much.
