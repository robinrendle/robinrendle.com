<p class="intro text-center">CSS-Tricks is a website about making websites. In 2014 I joined the team as a staff writer.</p>

<p class="intro">For almost a decade I wrote about new CSS features and made whacky experiments in the browser. I also wrote the newsletter each Sunday that went out to ~80,000 readers at one point.</p>

The most punk rock thing about working with the team was that I had free rein to write about whatever caught my eye, so
over the years I ranted about all sorts of subjects: from [CSS-only carousels](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-css-only-carousel/) and [the details element](https://css-tricks.com/exploring-what-the-details-and-summary-elements-can-do/) to design systems, [dark mode](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/) and [sticky stacked cards](https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/). But shortly after leaving CSS-Tricks, I made some notes about [my time working there](https://robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/):

> Chris has always been a mentor. Not just to me, but I think pretty much everyone working on the web these days. Not only is he fabulous writer that makes me mad with jealousy—to the point, funny, never taking the easy way out—Chris also showed me how to be a person on the internet. Don’t get into dumb fights. Treat people with respect. Kindness is the most important thing, etc. He built the team around CSS-Tricks and was always honorable, always did the right thing. If I ever end up running my own company or becoming a manager I’ll ask myself the same question every day:
