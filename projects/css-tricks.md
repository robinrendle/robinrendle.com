<p class="intro">CSS-Tricks is a popular website by Chris Coyier with articles about CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and all things related to web design and development. In 2014 I joined the team as a staff writer and had free rein to write about whatever I wanted. It was a dream gig.</p>

Over the years I wrote about everything; design systems, weird visual trends, new CSS features, and whacky experiments with what’s now possible in a web browser. Not only that but I made a ton of extremely fun prototypes to help me out.

Of all the things I wrote for CSS-Tricks, there’s a few articles that I’m still proud of:

1. [Exploring What the Details Element Can Do](https://css-tricks.com/exploring-what-the-details-and-summary-elements-can-do/)
2. [Stacked Cards with Sticky Positioning](https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/)
3. [Why is CSS frustrating?](https://css-tricks.com/why-is-css-frustrating/)
4. [How to Make a CSS-only Carousel](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-css-only-carousel/)
5. [Dark Mode and Variable Fonts](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/)

For years I also wrote the newsletter each Sunday that went out to more than 90,000 readers at one point. It was a great place to summarize all the drama in the front-end world and experience writing on a tight deadline.
