<p class="intro text-center">CSS-Tricks is a website about making websites. In 2014 I joined the team as a staff writer.</p>

<p class="intro">For almost a decade I wrote blog posts about new CSS features and made whacky experiments in the browser. I also wrote the newsletter each Sunday that went out to ~80,000 readers at one point.</p>

Over the years I made a [CSS-only carousel](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-css-only-carousel/) and explained [what the details element can do](https://css-tricks.com/exploring-what-the-details-and-summary-elements-can-do/). I wrote about [dark mode](https://css-tricks.com/dark-mode-and-variable-fonts/) and how to make [stacked cards with sticky positioning](https://css-tricks.com/stacked-cards-with-sticky-positioning-and-a-dash-of-sass/). I pushed back against [why folks are frustrated with CSS](https://css-tricks.com/why-is-css-frustrating/), too. So I’m real proud of the work we did together but none of this would have been possible without Chris’s guidance and encouragement.

I left CSS-Tricks just as Chris sold the company and wrote [a short eulogy of my time there](https://robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/):

> Chris has always been a mentor. Not just to me, but I think pretty much everyone working on the web these days. Not only is he fabulous writer that makes me mad with jealousy—to the point, funny, never taking the easy way out—Chris also showed me how to be a person on the internet. Don’t get into dumb fights. Treat people with respect. Kindness is the most important thing, etc. He built the team around CSS-Tricks and was always honorable, always did the right thing. If I ever end up running my own company or becoming a manager I’ll ask myself the same question every day:
>
> “What would Chris Coyier do?”

I learned so much during my time at CSS-Tricks, too. Working with the team certainly taught me how to broaden the scope of my work and to really explore a subject. Before joining the team I’d typically be pretty lazy about research but everyone would often return my work back to me with a never-said-but-always-implied “you can do better than this.”

And, slowly, eventually, I hope I did.
