<p class="intro text-center">Retool helps engineers make web apps. My job was to simplify the building blocks.</p>

<p class="intro">Engineers can write code and use an interactive canvas to design their app but I when I joined the team I noticed how often they struggled to perform common tasks.</p>

So I knew we needed a consolidated interface that allowed customers to search across these building blocks. For example, a new Scripts interface would give them handy tips on how to write JavaScript code within their apps:

What I imagined at first to be a quick tidy up project to find, categorize, and organize these actions quickly expanded as I fully understood the scope of the problem that customers struggled with. For example, after doing more research into IDEs I noticed that engineers like to stick with their keyboards.

And yet with Retool they would be forced to navigate back and forth between their keyboard and mouse which slowed them down. This made me think about how we could provide shortcuts for everything and reorganize the product to make it easier to stay focused.

This work led to the command bar where every setting, command, or asset would be right at their finger tips:

</figure>

As I pitched these prototypes to folks around the company we realized that the command bar wouldn’t just be useful for creating web apps in the IDE, but could be used across all of Retool’s products and features to make them more reliable, consistent, and predictable.

And I knew where we ought to begin: RetoolDB.

This was a long forgotten but essential product that customers used to store data before giving Retool access to their full database credentials. It was a playground for SQL data and it was especially important for new customers onboarding. So, considering we wanted to test the command bar and see if it was the right direction for the company, I worked with a separate team to test it here first:
