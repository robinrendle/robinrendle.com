<p class="intro">Search components, import data, and toggle settings with a redesigned Retool interface and command bar.</p> 

Customers struggled to learn the basics of Retool. Important actions were difficult to find and even experienced users who knew better struggled with dozens of unnecessary clicks. So how might we reimagine Retool to help them?

<!-- This project began when I asked customers to perform simple tasks to make their first web apps. I was trying to learn how new users navigate  it was clear right away that they struggled with dead-ends, switching back and forth between their mouse and keyboard, writing SQL, and importing their data. 

Menus within menus, clicks upon clicks.  -->

<!-- Customers needed a single home for adding components or importing data: they should be able to go window shopping, browse the primitives or root around the building blocks, so that they can get a sense of what’s possible if they’re unfamiliar with Retool. 

But! This interface shouldn’t get in the way of existing customers. Instead, it should speed them up, reducing the amount of clicks they need to do common actions in their daily routine.

I imagined a tool shed where you might see all the hammers and screwdrivers neatly arrayed on the wall. That’s what customers needed. -->

<!-- Explaining and categorizing these building blocks would be tough though, because at Retool we didn’t all agree about how to bucket them. Is JavaScript “data”? What is a resource? How should be break down these objects to make them understandable? -->

<!-- After feedback, I knew this design wasn’t right. The categories are confusing here and the visual style was pretty goofy. Navigation was painfully slow, too. But: I knew I was on the right track by combining these important actions together.

I remembered interviews I’d done with customers where they all mentioned how much they love Retool components and how they’re the most important thing. And in this design they’re all hidden away behind multiple levels of categories and what not. -->

<!-- How many times do you go to Stack Overflow to search for small snippets of code? Perhaps we could provide examples of scripts, both to teach new customers what was possible but also to help experienced customers when they get stuck. -->
