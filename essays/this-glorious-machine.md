<p class="intro">Riding an e-bike is like discovering a long forgotten secret of the universe or, perhaps, inventing something worthy of a heart-felt <em>“eureka!”</em> Look: here I am—alive–gliding through traffic on my first e-bike, blitzing past the stuffy tin cans all around me. I’ve become master of the four winds, now first place in a triathlon, now a mythical creature that can move at the speed of thought. Upon my trusty 6 gear steed I am Hermes, the lord of all heavenly motion.</p>

Just listen to this thing go! An e-bike makes every sound you find in a comic book: gears rattling, spokes spinning. I’m dashing between cars and blurry, bipedal pedestrians, but here at this moment, on my first ride to work, I can’t stop smiling as I pass everyone by. 

I’m also smiling because—unlike so any promises that tech has failed to deliver—e-bikes are genuinely worthy of an hour long presentation delivered in a turtleneck. If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, then an e-bike is a bicycle for our bicycles, a wonder of micro-mobility, as they reimagine our relationship not just with our bodies and our cities, but with the future of technology, too.

Simply put...

## E-bikes aren’t a dumb tech grift.

<p class="intro">Bicycles with electric motors on them have returned the hope I’d lost over the years as a tech worker; riding my bike through the city for the first time made me realize that tech doesn’t have to be a con or make us the worst versions of ourselves. Instead, technology has a responsibility to make the world better.</p>

_Technology can still make me feel like this_, I thought to myself as I zipped through the city.

Well, yes! E-bikes are from that alternate dimension, that hopeful universe, where technology isn’t just an infinite money glitch. These two wheeled bad boys aren’t only here to generate shareholder value but solve hard problems that actually help people.

Ducking and weaving in amongst traffic, I have the biggest smile on my face because it feels as if the city has cracked open before me like a great egg. I can keep up with the traffic and I don’t have to cycle on the side of the lane where I might easily get trapped between parked cars and those zipping by eagerly to avoid me. I’m not struggling to keep up with traffic anymore, in fact, traffic’s struggling to keep up with me.

On that first trip I realized that this little e-bike of mine offers a sharp critique against my cynicism of tech as a mere profit-generating tool. But these machines also offer a sharp critique of our cities and how we navigate them. Hop in the saddle and you’ll immediately notice how our cities have been built all wrong; for more than a century we’ve incentivized cars to segment and separate our country into human-free zones and endless freeways with generic, Lego-like city-scapes trapped in between.

Our cities don’t have to work like this and e-bikes show us a clear way out: every e-bike is a manifesto for lost common spaces, huge sidewalks with giant trees above and local shops within walking distance. Parks! Places you can sit down! Shade, shelter! 

Not just an in-between place or a hurdle to circumnavigate between your job and your home, e-bikes argue for a city to be proud of instead.


## E-bikes are more punk rock than motorcycles.

<p class="intro">For a decade my primary method of transportation was a motorcycle. Back in my early 20s I believed there was nothing more punk rock than an exploding hunk of metal beneath me; a roaring, screaming engine that could accelerate me across dinky villages in Devon or through the sparse and shining cities of Southern California.</p>

Bicycles were the opposite of all that freedom; for decades I associated them with my childhood and being trapped in my tiny hometown without access to the wider world. Bicycles weren’t objects of desire or of longing because they simply weren’t fast or loud. And to be cool there always has to be volume and speed. Drums? Fast. Loud. Cool. Hip hop? Same. Motorcycles? What did you say? I can’t hear you because my eardrums have shattered but what remains is a wonderful, heart-stompingly loud vibration in my chest; loudness personified and eternal.

But now, as I’m slipping between cars on my first e-bike after two decades of being mean and looking down on cyclists, I’m embarrassed to say I’ve thoroughly learned my lesson: bicycles, and e-bikes specifically, are cool as hell. I’m so very sorry.

Here’s the kicker though. They’re not cool because of the way they look or how loud they are and they’re certainly not cool because they turn heads or make strangers jealous. Instead, e-bikes are cool because they argue for a new kind of world where technology is genuinely helpful, where technology doesn’t have to be the antagonist, and where technology can do the job it’s meant to do. 


## E-bikes are the future we deserve.

<p class="intro">Towards the end of my first bike trip, coming home, I stopped at a crosswalk and a kid skipped through the street in front of me. She smiled and danced and then the most miraculous thing happened: she looked me up and down, laughed, and put her hand up to her head in the shape of an L.</p>

It was a devastating insult and undid several years of therapy in a flash. But _wow_, _sure_, _okay_, I thought to myself. I might very well be a nerd, a loser, perhaps even a cyclist now but no matter how much I love this machine it will never be truly cool. 

But isn’t that..._fine_?

<p>Cool tech is overrated anyway as we tend to think of ‘cool’ in all the wrong ways. We only see loudness and speed and aluminum, presented on stage to glorious fanfare as cool. We see minimalism and a hefty price tag or the unrealistic, bewildering promises that can’t possibly be kept and we think that’s cool, too.</p> 
  
<p>We don’t often think of hearing aids or <abbr>MRI</abbr> machines or clean drinking water or contact lenses. We don’t think of small, meaningful progress as cool. We can only see the revolutions, the money, the once-in-a-lifetime technologies as cool and I think this limits our understanding of what tech is capable of and what it should hope to do.</p>

I reckon this is important because a lot of folks in tech today are terrified of making something merely useful and equally terrified of that kid’s devastating, life-crushing, therapy-inducing L. Powerful tech folks are scared of not being cool because cool is essential for their ego, being cool is essential for their power. But I don’t think that being cool is essential for making something great.

So I wonder if technology can only progress if we ignore what’s cool. Imagine no more handsome, turtlenecked speeches or rapturous fanfare and applause. Imagine no more tech revolutions with the goal only to add a few zeroes to a spreadsheet or a bank account.

My little bicycle with an electric motor forces me to ask a much bigger question, I think:


## What if we make something useful instead?
