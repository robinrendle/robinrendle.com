<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">As my homeland slips further into </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/03/facebook-bubble-brexit-filter" style="font-size: 1em;">a zealous fever of madness</a><span style="font-size: 1em;">, this holiday weekend I’ll be committing&nbsp;my second act of treason by celebrating Independence Day. And so what better moment could there be to explore the typesetting of the Declaration of Independence?</span></p>

<p>A couple of years ago, Nick Sherman did just that when he wrote about the 240 year old founding document for&nbsp;<a href="http://fontsinuse.com/uses/1666/the-dunlap-broadside">Fonts In Use</a>. He went into great detail about its typography and commented on its… well, <em>ugliness</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a modern perspective, all of these factors might add up to the Dunlap Broadside being considered a poor example of typographic composition. However, there is something about it which transcends any aesthetic critique or commentary on the typefaces. In many ways it is a piece of printing in the highest form. It carried its message — one of the most important messages in the history of Western culture — quickly to a larger number of people than would have been possible otherwise. That practice of printing, the one that secured John Dunlap a spot below John Hancock in the history books, is a big part of what the United States is founded on. In the end, the freedom of the press isn’t about composing conceptually or aesthetically pleasing layouts, it’s about facilitating the communication of ideas.<br/>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this a great deal lately, about what the goal of typesetting should be. And it might take me a while to make the link here but I especially think of typography’s role whenever I hear one of these words: <em>Dvorak, Colemak, Qwerty.</em></p>

<p>Despite sounding like the codenames for a suite of Russian AI war bots designed to enslave us all, these are instead various types of keyboard configurations. The dominant type we’re all familiar with is Q-W-E-R-T-Y, named because of the order in which the letters appear in the top left of our keyboards. It was originally implemented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter">Scholes and Glidden</a>, the world’s first commercially successful typewriter in 1874, and we’ve lived with only a slightly modified version of this keyboard ever since:<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891029" height="624" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/9d9f3f14-4665-417c-96c4-7327f94c01f3.png" style="width: 384px; max-width: 384px;" width="384"/></p>

<p>This was a wonder of its time to be sure, but many of the typographic decisions that went into this typewriter and its predecessors went unquestioned for decades. In fact, Marcin Wichary wrote a particularly scathing article about <a href="https://medium.com/design/death-to-typewriters-9b7712847639#.nea0o9bea">his distaste for these machines</a> and the pure hell they wrought to the field of typography:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see, I blame typewriters for double-handedly setting typography back by centuries. Type before typewriters was a beautiful world filled with hard-earned nuance and richness, a universe of tradition and craftsmanship where letters and their arrangement could tell as many stories as the words and passages they portrayed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as I agree with Marcin’s argument and as much as <a href="https://medium.com/@mwichary/what-i-learned-about-languages-just-by-looking-at-a-turkish-typewriter-fc840aab1b0a#.m43t2vly9">his relationship with typewriters is a complicated one</a>, I can’t help but play devil’s advocate a little here; I mean, sure, the printed matter that was produced by these machines certainly wasn’t “good typography” by the standards of the time but it’s important to remember that the art of typography is not merely what is output at the end of the writing process. Typography is so much more than the letters printed on the page.</p>

<p>I try to remember that it’s an act and a process. Typography is the mechanical reproduction of our alphabet from start to finish, and the fact that these typewriters made the written word accessible to millions can’t be simply brushed aside. So as horrible as the outcome might be, I will always treasure the engineering, the scalability and the access to the written word far more than the mere aesthetic nuances I might secretly hope for.</p>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, that the year is 1494 and a group of Venetian scribes are huddled in a tavern, hovering over the first printed book by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldine_Press">Aldine Press</a>. They poke and prod at the book with swollen thumbs and calloused fingertips, the letters of the page and <a href="http://timescolumns.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451da9669e201b7c70d6bb8970b-pi">the press’ emblem</a> barely visible under the dim candlelight.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891037" height="857" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/26e749be-367e-4506-8841-803dc63f1da1.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"/></p>

<p>This book would have taken a fraction of the time to produce over their handwritten method, but they still pick at this ugly thing for its absence of <a href="http://ilovetypography.com/2015/11/20/pure-gold-incunabula-gold-typography/">illumination</a>, its uniformity and stark lack of nuance and fidelity. Each of these scribes in turn brag of their magnificent, handwritten letters, and each of them scoff at the mechanical nightmare wrought by Aldus’ press: <em>How basic, how primitive,</em> they boast.</p>

<p>The same can be said for the Declaration of Independence: the type was not American but rather comically the letters came from the London foundry Caslon, which was the regal “letter-founder to the King.” Not only that but the titles are tracked too far apart and the measure of each paragraph is much too wide for comfortable reading. But we must ignore these features because of the speed in which this document had to be printed. Our standards for “good typography” rarely takes this into account, but any typography is better than none at all.</p>

<p>Anyway…where was I? Oh yeah, keyboards.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about the typographic organisation of them since I read about the <a href="https://viralintrospection.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/a-different-philosophy-in-designing-keyboard-layouts/">Workman Layout</a> and as soon as I saw the post’s&nbsp;table of contents I knew that I was in for a wondrously nerdy ride. The programmer OJ Bucao describes his quest for the perfect keyboard layout where he decided to move all of the letters around to best fit his needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891041" height="213" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/05ec9a52-53e1-4c57-a497-3605aee31000.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640"/></p>

<p>Bucao wrote about his experience in designing&nbsp;this new layout:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It soon dawned on me that just moving a few things around isn’t going to cut it. It’s like playing with a water balloon. If you squeeze on one side, it bulges on other sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this idea! But manipulating a water balloon seems to be an apt metaphor for typography and design in general, let alone the configuration of a keyboard. For instance, if we make one element of a page colorful or larger than the rest then we in turn make all the other elements <em>smaller</em>. You cannot change a single element of a typographic composition without somehow distorting everything else in the space, too.</p>

<p>In other words, the art of typography is really just the art of juggling water balloons and hoping that they all don’t pop.</p>

<h2>The Week in Type</h2>

<p>First up, Stephen Coles has made a collection on Flickr which highlights some interesting <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/galleries/72157669873820592/">lettering he found in New Orleans cemeteries</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Type designer and <a href="https://twitter.com/fostertype/status/441173853167824898">expert Tweetist</a>, Dave Foster, has started a neat project where he’ll attempt to draw <a href="https://twitter.com/fostertype/status/748849317406908416">a new font for every day of the Tour de France</a>. So far I think Stage 2 is particularly delightful:<br/>

<p>David Shields has written a short biography of <a href="http://www.woodtyperesearch.com/william-morgans/">William Thomas Morgans</a>, who was one of the early pioneers wood type in the late 19th century.</p>

<hr>
<p>A friend asked aloud the other day which typefaces are available for the web that are peculiar and not already worn out or oversaturated in the field. Thankfully, several months ago <a href="http://kupferschrift.de/cms/2016/05/so-many-good-webfonts/">Indra Kupferschmid jotted down a helpful list</a> for everyone to reference.</p>

<hr>
<p>Over on Typeset in the Future, Dave Addey has written another excellent piece that breaks down odd typographic choices in movies, and this time he explores <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/">Blade Runner</a>.</p>

<h2>New type releases</h2>

<p>Type and Media is a type design Master degree program held at the Royal Academy of Art in the Netherlands and <a href="http://typemedia.org/?p=481">the final show</a> is currently taking place between July 1st through to the 7th. This is an opportunity to get a sneak peek of the type specimens from the graduates before they launch the new website (which I’m sure will be as great as <a href="http://www.typemedia2015.com/">last year’s gallery</a>).<br/>
<br/>

David Jonathan Ross made an update to <a href="https://djr.com/manicotti">Manicotti</a> recently by <a href="https://djr.com/manicotti/cyrillic-greek/">adding support for Cyrillic</a>. Manicotti is a typeface “inspired by the boisterous wood types of the nineteenth century” and oh boy oh boy if it isn’t my favourite reverse-stressed typeface out there at the moment:<br/>
<br/>

<p>On July 1st the Tiny Type Co., a new foundry by Rob Mientjes, <a href="https://twitter.com/tinytypeco/status/748815261671624705">opened for business</a> with two typeface releases. First up, <a href="http://tinytype.co/type/monumental-grotesk">Monumental Grotesk</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monumental Grotesk is a true The Hague typeface: its stone-carved forms grace a few buildings and a monument in the government quarters. It’s based on the work of graphic designer Piet Zwart, a Dutch Bauhaus proponent.</p>
</blockquote>

<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891065" height="231" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/75206fe9-5f1c-4286-a687-e6ad6c885202.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" />

<p>And Mientjes also released <a href="http://tinytype.co/type/dover-display">Dover Display</a>, which comes in two flavors: a geometric sans and a serif display face:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dover is a long-running exploration of the quintessential British types. It is an attempt at historical design fiction: what if Caslon and Gill Sans had been designed by the same person? What if that person were me?</p>
</blockquote>

<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891069" height="292" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/377cec32-1d65-4dd5-bb47-19ed7909d9b3.png" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" />

<hr>
<p>And finally, although I don’t think it’s commercially available just yet, <a href="https://twitter.com/font_taste?lang=en">Miguel Reyes</a> has been working on a new display face and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BHUh82aBFbi/">it’s really quite striking</a>:<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Letter of the week</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/klim_type_foundry/">Kris Sowersby’s account</a> is certainly in the running for the most beautiful galleries&nbsp;for fans of graphic design and type. He continuously posts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BE40cn0NPlT/">understated</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BD9N0mXtPi1/?taken-by=klim_type_foundry">lovely</a> snaps of his work as well as from examples he finds in the wild.</p>

Last week Kris published an image from a specimen of a wood type capital ‘R’ and I can’t stop thinking about it:<br/>
<br/>

<img class="tl-email-image" data-id="891077" height="640" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ed299f0ca02cd22d04c76c6e447e68a7851ec03d/images/159d3cd2-2270-4cb2-a069-f9af75c95f46.jpg" style="width: 640px; max-width: 640px;" width="640" />

<p>I find that these weird upturned right legs of Clarendon-esque ‘R’s make it ugly for word shapes in general but for standalone letters they are a thing of pure beauty.</p>

<p>Oh, on a final note, and speaking of beautiful letters, Elizabeth Carey Smith made <a href="https://twitter.com/theoriginalecs/status/747791903748399105">the call</a> for a fine looking capital ‘X’ and many type designers replied with their favourites.<br/>
